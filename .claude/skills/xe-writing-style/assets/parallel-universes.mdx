Our new feature,
[bucket forking](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/fork-buckets-like-code/), lets
you make an isolated copy of your large dataset instantly with zero copying. No
more colliding in shared datasets or waiting hours for bytes to copy, fork your
dataset like you fork your code, and experiment away.

## Experimentation enabled by bucket forking

Imagine a world where an AI company's researchers can instantly experiment with
an entire, massive training dataset in object storage, without the days-long
wait for copies or the uncertainty of using live data. This addresses a common
pattern where developers create and then abandon numerous copies of central
datasets for individual experiments, leading to significant duplication and
wasted time.

We’re proposing a new workflow: create per-user (or per-run)
[forks](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/buckets/snapshots-and-forks/) of your
dataset, do your experimentation and development, and then merge your updated
data back into main. Just like git, and it’s as fast as forking a git repo.

When you fork a bucket, you get an isolated copy that’s a metadata reference to
your original dataset. Writes to the source bucket aren’t replicated to the
fork: their timelines have diverged at the moment of the fork. Tigris only
stores the changes, so there’s no duplication.

## Bucket forking and the scientific method

Let’s follow an experiment using the scientific method: you want your model to
match the painterly aesthetic of a video game, but you aren’t sure which subset
of screenshots will finetune your model best. Should you train on screenshots of
the entire game? Should you make individual “experts” for deserts vs ocean
scenes? Should you remove the borders and menus? Do you really need to downscale
the images to 512x512 like you did in the early days of Stable Diffusion v1.5?
How about the aspect ratio or greyscaling... the list goes on.

Each of these variations is an experiment, a parallel timeline for your data.
Without forking, you’d need a frozen copy for each experiment for control, so
you’d cull the list to minimize the number of parallel datasets. Or you’d share
data across experiments and track the changes. But with forking, you can
instantly make a copy so you can try all of them at once. Trivially.

We're going to make changes across the entire dataset to optimize the data for
the models we want to train. Instead of making multiple copies of the dataset,
we're going to use bucket forking for these experiments. But, in order to talk
about that, first we need to talk about parallel universes.

## Dataset experimentation with parallel universes

In the real world, datasets arrive as messy unlabeled piles of bytes that we
have to make sense of in order to do useful things. As an example, let’s take
our example, a
[dataset of Nintendo Switch game screenshots](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XeIaso/switch-screenshots).
With all this data, you could do any number of things, such as:

- Train a categorization model, or something that can take these screenshots and
  then learn what patterns are associated with which games so I can upload new
  screenshots and have them automatically categorized with the right tags for
  the right game.
- Train a style emulation LoRA adapter for existing text to image models that
  lets me create more images based on the style of individual games in that
  screenshot collection.
- Use a combination of OCR and other language models to distill knowledge about
  the screenshots into a vision model.

Today I’m going to show you how you would do this kind of experimental massaging
from a bucket-forking native mindset. In my case, I want to take that dataset of
Nintendo Switch screenshots and isolate things out so that I can train a Stable
Diffusion LoRA on screenshots from
[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild).
This will require the following steps:

- Importing all the jpegs into a dataset
- Filtering out all the images that aren’t from Breath of the Wild
- Synthesizing captions
- Filtering out unwanted images (IE: those in menus)
- Sending it to a GPU for training

We'll end up with four parallel timelines for our data, each a controlled lab
for our experiments. Here's a sketch.

![Forking buckets to clean data and try three different experiments](./forks-timeline.svg)

### Fork 1: Data cleaning and labeling

Right now my data is a giant pile of thousands of flat files I copied off of my
Switch’s SD card. It’s got a bunch of filenames that look like this:

```
screenshots/2022/03/03/2022030300000900-1E1800B8D04F999C436DDFE2B8CD0B81.jpg
```

The filenames are broken down like this:

```
${date}-${titleID}.jpg
```

So that example would be a screenshot of Dark Souls Remastered that I took in
early March 2023\.

I had Claude write
[a little shell script](https://gist.github.com/Xe/947d90506da90cd16d3ca91a9f892f15)
that broke down this input folder and renamed the files like this:

```
./var/switch-screenshots/train/${titleID}/${date}.jpg
```

Then I imported it to a Tigris bucket with a little bit of Python code:

```py
from datasets import load_dataset
import os

BUCKET_NAME = "xe-screenshots-multiworld"
storage_options = {
    "key": os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
    "secret": os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"),
    "endpoint_url": "https://fly.storage.tigris.dev"
}

ds = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_dir="./var/switch-screenshots", split="train")

ds.save_to_disk(f"s3://{BUCKET_NAME}/images", storage_options=storage_options)
```

Then let’s freeze this state in time by creating a snapshot:

```py
import boto3
from botocore.client import Config

def create_bucket_snapshot(bucket_name, desc):
    tigris = boto3.client(
        "s3",
        endpoint_url="https://t3.storage.dev",
        config=Config(s3={'addressing_style': 'virtual'}),
    )

    tigris.meta.events.register(
        "before-sign.s3.CreateBucket",
        lambda request, **kwargs: request.headers.add_header(
            "X-Tigris-Snapshot", f"true; desc={desc}"
        )
    )
    return tigris.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)["ResponseMetadata"]["HTTPHeaders"]["x-tigris-snapshot-version"]

create_bucket_snapshot(BUCKET_NAME, "imported dataset from the disk")
```

And then we can make sure it’s there by listing all the snapshots:

```py
def list_snapshots_for_bucket(bucket_name):
    tigris = boto3.client(
        "s3",
        endpoint_url="https://t3.storage.dev",
        config=Config(s3={'addressing_style': 'virtual'}),
    )

    tigris.meta.events.register(
        "before-sign.s3.ListBuckets",
        lambda request, **kwargs: request.headers.add_header("X-Tigris-Snapshot", bucket_name)
    )

    return tigris.list_buckets()

for snapshot in list_snapshots_for_bucket(BUCKET_NAME)['Buckets']:
    name, desc = snapshot["Name"].split("; desc=")
    snaptime = snapshot["CreationDate"].strftime("%s")
    print(f"name={name} time={snaptime} desc=\"{desc}\"")
```

That returns something like this:

```javascript
{'name': '1760036788104497556', 'time': '1760054788', 'desc': 'imported dataset from the disk'}
```

So we can use this snapshot to create a fork of the bucket:

```py
def create_bucket_fork(bucket_name, from_bucket, snapshot_id=None):
    tigris = boto3.client(
        "s3",
        endpoint_url="https://t3.storage.dev",
        config=Config(s3={'addressing_style': 'virtual'}),
    )

    tigris.meta.events.register(
        "before-sign.s3.CreateBucket",
        lambda request, **kwargs: (
            request.headers.add_header("X-Tigris-Fork-Source-Bucket", from_bucket),
        )
    )
    if snapshot_id is not None:
        tigris.meta.events.register(
            "before-sign.s3.CreateBucket",
            lambda request, **kwargs: (
                request.headers.add_header("X-Tigris-Fork-Source-Bucket-Snapshot", snapshot_id),
            )
        )
    tigris.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)

botw_only_bucket = f"{BUCKET_NAME}-botw"
create_bucket_fork(botw_only_bucket, BUCKET_NAME, "1760036788104497556")
```

And then make some helpers to load the dataset from that fork:

```py
from datasets import load_from_disk

def load_timeline(bucket_name):
    return load_from_disk(f"s3://{bucket_name}/images", storage_options=storage_options)

def save_timeline(ds, bucket_name):
    ds.save_to_disk(f"s3://{bucket_name}/images", storage_options=storage_options)
```

:::note

Something cool about the bucket forking flow is that this treats your bucket
paths as part of your public API. You don’t need to think about where you load
the dataset from the bucket, because that’s not the variable that changed.
You’re just loading the data from a different timeline.

:::

### Filtering

From here we can filter everything that isn’t from Breath of the Wild out of the
dataset. According to
[the Switchbrew wiki](https://switchbrew.org/w/index.php?title=Title_list/Games&mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop),
the title ID for Breath of the Wild is `F1C11A22FAEE3B82F21B330E1B786A39`. Let’s
set this as a global variable and then filter everything else out:

```py
BOTW_TITLE_ID = "F1C11A22FAEE3B82F21B330E1B786A39"

ds = load_timeline(botw_only_bucket)
ds = ds.filter(lambda x: ds.features['label'].names[x['label']] == BOTW_TITLE_ID)
print(f"filtered dataset size: {len(ds)}")

save_timeline(ds, botw_only_bucket)
```

Then we can make a snapshot of the bucket in this state:

```py
botw_only_snapshot_id = create_bucket_snapshot(botw_only_bucket, "Dataset filtered down to only images of Breath of the Wild")
```

### Fork 2: Caption Synthesis

I use this dataset for other training projects so I don't want to apply the
captions to the common dataset. I want to leave the underlying / central data
the same and add my captions in its own little fork. Let’s start by diverging
the timeline for captioning and make a fork:

```py
caption_bucket = f"{BUCKET_NAME}-captions"
create_bucket_fork(caption_bucket, botw_only_bucket, botw_only_snapshot_id)
ds = load_timeline(caption_bucket)
```

From here we add an empty column for the text caption (our training workflow
will require this to be called `text`):

```py
text_data = [""] * len(ds)
ds = ds.add_column("text", text_data)
```

Then we can generate high-quality captions using a few-shot process. For this I
went into Breath of the Wild and captured some screenshots I’ll use to make my
own high quality captions as examples for the language model. I’m including a
few images in my dataset, capturing the following scenarios/scenes:

- Link in a grassy field
- Link in the desert
- Link paragliding through the air
- Menu interactions

These base captions will help “ground” the model so it creates more captions
like my examples. For the captioning I’m going to be using
[gemma3:4b](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3:4b) on a local device, but you can
use whatever model you want.

:::note

This is where you can fork the timeline to diverge\!

:::

I’ll set up Ollama in another cell:

```py
!pip install ollama
import ollama

OLLAMA_MODEL = "gemma3:4b"
OLLAMA_URL = "http://192.168.2.12:11434"

llm = ollama.Client(host=OLLAMA_URL)

llm.pull(OLLAMA_MODEL)
```

And then my base image captioning code will look like this:

<details>
<summary>Longer code block</summary>

```py
response = llm.chat(model=OLLAMA_MODEL, messages=[
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are an expert image captioner assigned to caption images about video games. When given an image, make sure to only include the image caption, nothing else.",
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Please caption this image",
        "images": [load_image_b64("./few_shot/botw/gerudo_desert.JPG")]
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "in_BOTW The Gerudo Desert, Link is facing the camera, A mountain range in the distance, A shrine surrounded by palm trees",
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Please caption this image",
        "images": [load_image_b64("./few_shot/botw/menus.JPG")]
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "in_BOTW A menu showing Link's armor sets, Desert Voe Trousers, Inventory menu",
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Please caption this image",
        "images": [load_image_b64("./few_shot/botw/lanaru_rocks.JPG")]
    },
])
```

</details>

When I give it an example image, such as this:

![Link looking out over the rocks to the southeast near Lake Hylia in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](./img/hylia-rocks.jpg)

I get a caption like this:

```
in_BOTW Link standing atop a hill in Hyrule, overlooking the landscape
```

This is good enough for me! Now to apply this to the entire dataset:

<details>
<summary>Longer code block</summary>

```py
from base64 import b64encode
from io import BytesIO

def load_image_b64(fname):
    with open(fname, "rb") as fin:
        data = fin.read()

    b64 = b64encode(data).decode("utf-8")

    return b64

def pil_to_b64(image):
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format="JPEG")
    return b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode("utf-8")

def fabricate_caption(row):
    response = llm.chat(model=OLLAMA_MODEL, messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are an expert image captioner assigned to caption images about video games. When given an image, make sure to only include the image caption, nothing else.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Please caption this image",
            "images": [load_image_b64("./few_shot/botw/gerudo_desert.JPG")],
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "in_BOTW The Gerudo Desert, Link is facing the camera, A mountain range in the distance, A shrine surrounded by palm trees",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Please caption this image",
            "images": [load_image_b64("./few_shot/botw/menus.JPG")],
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "in_BOTW A menu showing Link's armor sets, Desert Voe Trousers, Inventory menu",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Please caption this image",
            "images": [load_image_b64("./few_shot/botw/lanaru_rocks.JPG")],
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "in_BOTW Link standing atop a series of rocks overlooking the landscape, blue partially cloudy sky",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Please caption this image",
            "images": [load_image_b64("./few_shot/botw/paragliding.JPG")],
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "in_BOTW Link paragliding over Hyrule field with mountains in the distance, an empty field of green grass is below him"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Please caption this image",
            "images": [pil_to_b64(row["image"])],
        },
    ])

    row["text"] = response.message.content
    return row

ds = ds.map(fabricate_caption)
```

</details>

Perfect\! Now let’s save it:

```py
save_timeline(ds, caption_bucket)
caption_snapshot_id = create_bucket_snapshot(caption_bucket, "Added captions to the dataset")
caption_snapshot_id
```

### Fork 3: Better captioning and different models

When I was looking through the dataset I noticed that some of the captions
weren’t ideal, so I thought that I should redo them by changing the prompting
theory to be closer to what Stable Diffusion XL natively prefers. However, I
don't know if this new method will be any better. I want to preserve the old
captions so I can compare them. Let’s see if a different captioning method will
work better. I want to preserve the first experiment so I can compare; thus I
forked the bucket.

```py
better_caption_bucket = f"{BUCKET_NAME}-better-captions"
create_bucket_fork(better_caption_bucket, botw_only_bucket, botw_only_snapshot_id)
```

I took one of the few-shotted images and asked Gemini Pro 2.5 to describe it as
a Stable Diffusion prompt:

import gerudoShrine from "./img/gerudo-shrine.jpg";

<Conv name="Xe" profilePic={xe} top>
Can you describe this image as if it was a Stable Diffusion XL prompt? Think about how it would be represented if it was the subtitle in a museum.

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "95%" }}
  src={gerudoShrine}
  alt="A picture of Link in the Gerudo Desert wearing a lightweight desert outfit
  near a black shrine with blue leylines all over it."
/>

</Conv>
<Conv name="Gemini 2.5 Pro" profilePic={geminiLogo} bottom>
  masterpiece, best quality, cinematic screenshot from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, (view from behind of Link:1.2) wearing golden pauldrons and Gerudo desert gear, standing in a sun-drenched desert oasis with palm trees, a massive ancient stone monolith Sheikah Shrine covered in (glowing blue neon constellations and intricate patterns:1.3), wide shot, painterly cel-shaded art style, vibrant colors, strong shadows, epic fantasy, atmospheric, distant rocky mesas under a bright blue sky with wispy clouds.
</Conv>

This is much better than the older prompts and will likely get better results
when doing training. I made a new timeline forked from before I made captions
the first time:

```py
ds = load_timeline(better_caption_bucket)

text_data = [""] * len(ds)
ds = ds.add_column("text", text_data)
```

I replaced all of the few-shotted captions in my notebook with Gemini generated
captions like that.

<details>
<summary>Longer code block</summary>

```
def fabricate_caption(row):
    response = llm.chat(model=OLLAMA_MODEL, messages=[

            "content": "in_BOTW masterpiece, best quality, 8k, cinematic screenshot from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, (view from behind of Link:1.2) wearing blue armor and a blue hood, standing on a lush green hilltop, looking out over a vast, expansive landscape of rolling green hills, rocky cliffs, and distant mountains under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds, wide shot, painterly cel-shaded art style, vibrant colors, strong shadows, epic fantasy, atmospheric.",
        },

        },
    ])

    row["text"] = response.message.content
    return row

ds = ds.map(fabricate_caption)
```

</details>

Then I investigated a few image-caption pairs:

This would be much better to train a LoRA on\!

### Fork 4: Resizing to train Stable Diffusion

Now that I have the images and captions, I want to start optimizing the image
size for the model I want to train. This requires a destructive action across
every image in the dataset.

When training Stable Diffusion, you generally want your images to meet specific
resolutions:

- If you are using Stable Diffusion v1.5, you want the resolution of your images
  to add up to 1024 (eg 512x512, 768x384, etc.)
- If you are using Stable Diffusion XL, you want the resolution of your images
  to add up to 2048 (eg 1024x1024, 1344x768, etc.)

Actions across the entire dataset like this are a poster child for making a
fork:

```py
resized_bucket = f"{BUCKET_NAME}-512-centre-crop"
create_bucket_fork(resized_bucket, better_caption_bucket)
```

Based on the fact that all of my images are 1280x720, without upscaling them the
best model to train against is Stable Diffusion v1.5. This means I need to
centre crop the images to 512x512. Another experiment/fork could involve
resizing the images to something like 768x384 to get closer to the original 16:9
aspect ratio. Here's how I resized all the images in the dataset:

```py
from PIL import Image

def center_crop_resize(image, size=512):
    width, height = image.size
    min_side = min(width, height)
    left = (width - min_side) // 2
    top = (height - min_side) // 2
    right = left + min_side
    bottom = top + min_side
    cropped = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))
    return cropped.resize((size, size), Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)

def resize_row(row):
    row["image"] = center_crop_resize(row["image"])
    return row

ds = load_timeline(resized_bucket)
ds = ds.map(resize_row)
```

Once I’m done, I just save the data to Tigris so I can try using it in training:

```py
save_timeline(ds, resized_bucket)
snapshot_id = create_bucket_snapshot(resized_bucket)
```

Et voila! I can do my Stable Diffusion v1.5 training fearlessly.

## Thinking with portals

In the process of working on this, we ended up with four different forks of our
dataset. These are:

- The base dataset (mostly unaltered from the original Switch SD card)
- A version of it that only has screenshots of Breath of the Wild
- A version of it with a first pass at captioning
- A version of it with a better pass at captioning
- A version of the better pass at captioning but cropped and resized for Stable
  Diffusion training

See how this maps more cleanly to the experimental process? The artifacts of
this are easily visible and nothing was deleted in the process. This is how you
think with ~~portals~~ bucket forking!

From here all you have to do is submit your dataset to be trained. I’d suggest
doing some more filtering before training such as removing rows with keywords
like “menu”, “message”, or “text” in them, but this is something you can freely
experiment with on your own. If you want to check out the dataset I filtered out
when I was writing this post, I posted
[a copy of it](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XeIaso/botw-screenshots-captioned)
to Hugging Face.

- The raw set of all of my Switch screenshots:
  [XeIaso/switch-screenshots](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XeIaso/switch-screenshots).
- The Breath of the Wild screenshots with better captions:
  [XeIaso/botw-screenshots-captioned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XeIaso/botw-screenshots-captioned).
- The centre cropped screenshots with better captions:
  [XeIaso/botw-screenshots-captioned-square](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XeIaso/botw-screenshots-captioned-square).

I plan to train Stable Diffusion on it when I get the time.

The important thing to keep in mind is that this model of being able to reset
things and fork the timeline when they go awry or you want to try multiple
different things. What if you tried using a different model for describing the
screenshots? What if you tried a different few shot prompting flow? What if your
filtering logic was different? Each of those can be cleanly forked off and tried
in their own little universes without impacting any of the data. All of the data
in the source bucket remains safe in Tigris even though we’ve been whittling it
down as things get filtered out.

See how this maps to the normal experimental workflow we do with things like
chemistry, physics, and other natural sciences? If at first you don’t succeed by
changing a variable you think will work out, travel back in time, destroy the
universe you were just in, and try again.

As our dataset complexity grows, isolation like this and tight controls over
data provenance have become so much more important and painful to manage
manually. Tigris’ bucket snapshots and forks make it trivial for you to grab a
dataset from cold storage and then do whatever transformations you want without
the fear of overwriting something important.
