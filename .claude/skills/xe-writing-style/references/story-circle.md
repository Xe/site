Use this as a narrative scaffold when turning a brain dump into a full Xe-style post.

## Core Story Circle (Xe-flavored)

1. **Normal World / Context**
   - Open with a concrete scene, historical analogy, or personal memory.
   - Establish the baseline expectations that will be challenged.
   - Example pattern: long opening paragraph that frames a craft, product, or lived experience.

2. **Need / Tension**
   - Name the discomfort, contradiction, or loss.
   - Use strong, direct statements or rhetorical questions.
   - Make it personal and grounded in real constraints.

3. **Go / Crossing the Threshold**
   - Shift into the present problem or system you are critiquing.
   - Make a clear, opinionated claim about what changed.
   - Introduce the technical stakes or market incentives.

4. **Search / Escalation**
   - Walk through evidence, examples, and tradeoffs.
   - Use concrete details: tooling, metrics, screenshots, quotes, or links.
   - Mix long explanation with short emphasis lines.

5. **Find / The Core Insight**
   - Reveal the central insight, often a critique of incentives or a design failure.
   - Keep it blunt and memorable.
   - Anchor it in values: craft, usability, security, or human cost.

6. **Take / Consequences**
   - Show what the insight costs: time, safety, craft, trust, people.
   - Include personal stakes and admissions.
   - Use character dialogue if it sharpens the point.

7. **Return / Proposed Path**
   - Offer a pragmatic approach, even if partial.
   - Explain tradeoffs and why the plan is "good enough".
   - Give readers steps or criteria for decisions.

8. **Change / New Baseline**
   - End with forward momentum or a sober question.
   - Reconnect to the opening frame.
   - Keep it honest: no false optimism.

## Post-Specific Story Maps

### Rolling the ladder up behind us

- **Context:** Historical analogy about cloth and the Luddites.
- **Tension:** Craft dies when expertise is not renewed.
- **Threshold:** Industry only hires seniors, avoids training.
- **Escalation:** AI "vibe coding" as short-term win, long-term rot.
- **Insight:** The problem is incentives and ownership, not tools.
- **Consequences:** Human cost, loss of craft, social harm.
- **Return:** Call for care in deployment and respect for craft.
- **Change:** A warning and a demand for better outcomes.

### They squandered the holy grail

- **Context:** Personal Apple history and the "bicycles for the mind" vision.
- **Tension:** Apple Intelligence promised a transformative leap.
- **Threshold:** Private Cloud Compute drops a radical security model.
- **Escalation:** Feature-by-feature analysis with concrete examples.
- **Insight:** They had the holy grail of trusted compute and wasted it.
- **Consequences:** Trust erosion, user harm, unusable features.
- **Return:** Identify what would have mattered and why.
- **Change:** A lament and a call to value real craft over hype.

### Building native packages is complicated

- **Context:** Anubis explodes in popularity; users want native packages.
- **Tension:** "Just build a tarball" hides real complexity.
- **Threshold:** Threat model and security posture are made explicit.
- **Escalation:** Detailed constraints, risks, and UX tradeoffs.
- **Insight:** Packaging must preserve trust and be distribution-agnostic.
- **Consequences:** Burnout risk, security failures, support debt.
- **Return:** Scope reduction, pragmatic plan, invite downstream packagers.
- **Change:** Clear path forward without pretending it's easy.

### Anything can be a message queue if you use it wrongly enough

- **Context:** Satirical warning box and a big, dramatic threat setup.
- **Tension:** Managed NAT Gateway cost pain and cloud billing absurdity.
- **Threshold:** Pivot to a "better" way, then ground it with a safety aside.
- **Escalation:** Long-form technical walkthrough with analogies and dialogue.
- **Insight:** The cursed solution works in theory, but the warning is the point.
- **Consequences:** You could do it, but you should not; expertise is required.
- **Return:** Re-center on what is actually safe to adopt.
- **Change:** Reader leaves with caution and a concrete mental model.

## Practical Use

- Use the **Context -> Tension -> Threshold** trio to frame the hook.
- Use **Escalation** to justify the critique with details and evidence.
- Use **Insight -> Consequences** to land the core argument.
- Use **Return -> Change** to end with pragmatic next steps or a sober question.
