# Emotional & Personal Writing

How Xe writes deeply personal posts about identity, healing, and lived
experience.

## When to Read This

Read when the post deals with: coming out, identity, grief, self-forgiveness,
burnout, family relationships, vulnerability, or any subject where Xe is the
emotional center of the piece.

## Core Patterns

### Raw Directness

Personal posts strip away technical wit and speak plainly. Sentences get
shorter. Vocabulary gets simpler. The craft is in the restraint.

- "I forgive me."
- "You've lost me."
- "I don't feel comfortable with myself as I am right now."
- "I remain."

### Refrain and Repetition

Emotional posts use refrains — a phrase repeated at intervals to build weight
and rhythm. The refrain anchors the emotional argument the way a thesis anchors
an essay.

Examples:

- "I forgive me" repeated as section openings, building from self-analysis to
  resolution
- "Even if I feel like things are a 'failure'. Even if other people report that
  it is a 'failure'."
- "and the next; and the next; and the next; and the next"

### Scare Quotes as Emotional Distance

Words like "failure" appear in quotes to interrogate the concept itself. The
quotes signal: this is a label others impose that I'm choosing to examine rather
than accept.

### Poetic Line Breaks

When emotion peaks, prose breaks into short lines or stanzas:

```
Just because I'm not human,

even though I'm more Human

than he can ever hope to be.
```

This is deliberate — it forces the reader to slow down and sit with each phrase.

### Content Warnings via Character Dialogue

For heavier personal content, Xe uses a `<Conv>` block at the top as a content
warning that feels human rather than clinical:

```jsx
<Conv name="Cadey" mood="enby">
  Content warning: this post talks about the transgender/nonbinary coming out of
  the closet experience. If you are not in the best headspace for that, feel
  free to skip this post until you're ready. This post isn't going to randomly
  vanish.
</Conv>
```

Note the reassurance: "It will be there when you're ready." This is
characteristic — even warnings carry warmth.

## Emotional Modes

### Self-Forgiveness / Healing

Structure: Acknowledge the harm → trace where it came from → refuse to
perpetuate the cycle → declare a new path forward.

Tone: Meditative, deliberate, almost liturgical. Sentences read like
affirmations.

Key quote: "Going forward, I will love where I hated in the past."

### Coming Out / Identity

Structure: State the discomfort → describe the fork in the road → choose honesty
→ name the fear → show the aftermath.

Tone: Measured and brave. Written to a specific audience (family, community) but
published publicly as an act of solidarity.

Key pattern: Xe often addresses the reader directly — "You don't have to keep
anyone around you that can't accept you for who you are."

### Grief and Loss

Structure: Establish what was lost → sit in the feeling → don't resolve it
neatly.

Tone: Sparse. No forced optimism. Loss stays present.

Key quote from fiction processing grief: "Goodbye, world. May We never be Alone
again."

## What NOT to Do

- Don't soften the emotional directness. If the draft says "I struggled with
  this," don't revise to "There were challenges." Keep the "I."
- Don't add humor to personal posts unless Xe's notes indicate that tone. The
  absence of jokes IS the signal.
- Don't wrap up with a neat resolution. Healing is ongoing. "I probably will be
  healing for a long time and I have accepted that."
- Don't explain the emotion — embody it. Show the feeling through rhythm and
  word choice, not through labeling it.
- Don't use character dialogue for comic relief in these posts. When characters
  appear, they carry emotional weight or provide content warnings.

## Distinctive Patterns

- **Idiom deconstruction**: Xe takes common sayings and traces them to their
  fuller, original meaning. Example: "blood is thicker than water" → "the blood
  of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb."
- **Family of choice over family of origin**: A recurring theme. Bonds you
  choose > bonds you inherited.
- **Letters as blog posts**: Some personal posts are literally letters (the
  coming-out email, the Heroku farewell) published for wider resonance.
- **Horizontal rules as emotional scene breaks**: `---` between sections signals
  a tonal or temporal shift.
