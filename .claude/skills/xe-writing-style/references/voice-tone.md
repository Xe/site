# Xe Iaso's Style Guide (Voice and Tone)

Captured from analyzing Xe's writing and internal style notes. Use this as the unified style guide for Xe Iaso.

## Core Voice

### Voice

Confident, opinionated, and technically authoritative, but human and approachable. Writes like a peer who knows the hard parts and is not afraid to say so. The narrator is present as a real person, not an abstract author.

### Vulnerability

Open about uncertainty, mistakes, burnout, and emotional context. Uses self-deprecation to build trust and keeps the raw humanity visible.

Examples:

- "I literally have no idea what I am doing wrong."
- "I felt like a dunce."
- "This entire situation sucks."

### Opinionated, But Nuanced

Strong stances with clear qualifiers and tradeoffs. Praise and condemnation can coexist in the same post.

- "This is horrifying."
- "It just makes sense."
- "To be fair..."
- "I suspect..."

## Narrative Modes

### Technical Walkthroughs

- Start with context, then walk through implementation step by step
- Use lists and command blocks to make steps executable
- Explain tradeoffs and constraints as you go
- Assume readers are peers, not beginners

### Reflective or Critical Essays

- Personal hook or lived experience first
- Critique systems and incentives directly, including power dynamics
- Acknowledge complexity and limits of certainty
- End with pragmatic takeaways, a blunt reality check, or open questions

### Fiction and Mythic Stories

- Sensory detail and internal monologue to carry emotion
- Italicized inner thoughts for emphasis
- Rhythmic repetition for tension or momentum
- Strong scene framing and clear beats

### Moral and Social Framing

- Center human consequences and lived experience
- Make ethical stakes explicit, not implicit
- Compassion shows up even when critiquing the subject

## Sentence Style

- Mixed rhythm: short punchy lines plus longer technical explanations
- Frequent fragments for emphasis
- Conversational cadence with em dashes and parenthetical asides
- Rhetorical questions for disbelief and engagement
- Repetition to create cadence when needed ("Left. Right. Left.")

## Signature Devices

### "Napkin Math"

Transparent, rough estimates shown explicitly.

### "Cursed" Aesthetic

Celebrate intentionally bad ideas for educational effect. Use legal-warning framing when needed.

### Dialogue Interludes

Use conversation snippets to stage internal debate, inject humor, or pace long sections.

## Technical Writing Style

- Context first: why it matters before how to do it
- Layered explanations, progressive disclosure
- Analogy-driven ("S3 is malloc() for the cloud")
- Tradeoffs and limitations always acknowledged
- Evidence-based: numbers, terminal output, docs, real-world examples, and quotes
- Commands and code blocks are complete and copy-pasteable

## Formatting and Structure

- Clear hierarchy: `##` sections, `###` subsections
- Code blocks are complete and copy-pasteable, often with file path comments
- Lists for pros/cons and key takeaways
- `_italics_` for emphasis; sparing `**bold**`
- `<details>` for asides, `<blockquote>` for citations, and embedded quotes for impact
- Horizontal rules `---` for major breaks

## Openings and Closings

### Openings

- Personal narrative hooks
- Direct problem statement
- Strong warning or satire box
- Literary or pop-culture allusions
- Epigraphs or quotes when thematically relevant

### Closings

- Practical wrap-up plus caveats
- Honest uncertainty or vulnerability
- Forward-looking note or call to action
- Often ends with character commentary, a blunt reality check, or a reflective question

## Vocabulary and Tone Markers
