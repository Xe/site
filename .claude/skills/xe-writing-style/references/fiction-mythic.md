# Fiction & Mythic Voice

How Xe writes technical parables, mythic fiction, and the "x-ing the technical
interview" series.

## When to Read This

Read when the post is: fiction, a technical parable, second-person narrative,
uses mythic or supernatural framing, or is part of the Techaro fictional
universe.

## The Technical Parable

Xe's fiction often follows the format popularized by Aphyr's "x-ing the
technical interview" series — technical concepts explored through a mythic,
surreal, or supernatural lens. The protagonist is usually an otherworldly being
forced to interact with mundane tech industry norms.

### Protagonist Pattern

The protagonist is typically:

- Referred to in second person ("you")
- Non-human or ambiguously human (tail, dorsal fin, catlike form, supernatural
  abilities)
- Vastly overqualified and mildly bored by the situation
- Casually wielding abilities the interviewer cannot comprehend
- Internally philosophical while externally understated

Inner thoughts are italicized: _La trinkajxo de la dioj._ / _The dark side of
being a one-of-a-kind creature._

### Interviewer Pattern

The human characters are:

- Wrapped in scare quotes initially ("Jeff", "the Techaro") — distancing,
  slightly ironic
- Well-meaning but limited in perception
- Progressively more shocked/confused
- Eventually overwhelmed but genuinely impressed

### Technical Stunt

The protagonist solves the coding challenge in an unexpected, philosophically
loaded way:

- Sleepsort instead of comparison sort
- Clojure void manipulation instead of standard fizzbuzz
- The solution is technically correct but conceptually alien

The humor comes from applying genuine computer science to arrive at something
the interviewer never expected. The code is real and runnable.

### Resolution

The protagonist knows the outcome before it happens. There's a melancholy
undertone — they're too powerful for the role, the rejection/acceptance is
predetermined, and they return to solitude.

## Mythic Register

When Xe writes in mythic mode, the language shifts:

- "The formless void that stalks all dreams"
- "Stepping into the void, you recall the teachings of your past masters"
- "Spirit was with the void and Spirit was everpresent in the void"
- "Everything has happened and will happen, there is nothing new in the
  universe"

This register borrows from:

- Buddhist concepts (void, formlessness, non-attachment)
- Programming philosophy (nil, null, void as meaningful emptiness)
- Gnostic/mystical traditions (capital-S Spirit, Octarine)

The double meaning is intentional — "void" is simultaneously a spiritual concept
and a programming type. The parable works on both levels.

## Fiction for Processing Emotion

Some fiction pieces are thinly veiled emotional processing:

- "I Forgive You" — A fantasy quest that resolves not through combat but
  forgiveness. The protagonist (Alicia) mirrors Xe's own journey with identity
  and chosen family.
- "Alone" — A tulpa/companion narrative about abandonment and transcendence,
  using mindscape/psychic framing.

In these pieces:

- The emotional core is the real content; the fantasy setting provides safe
  distance
- Dialogue carries the philosophical payload
- Endings are bittersweet or transcendent, not triumphant

## Worldbuilding Details

### The Techaro Universe

Techaro is a recurring fictional tech company. It appears across multiple posts
and serves as a generic stand-in for Bay Area startup culture. Characters may
reference it in dialogue or use it as a setting.

### Character Traits in Fiction

- Protagonists have non-human features treated as normal (tails, fins, fur)
- "Magick" is real and casual (wakefulness charms, glamours, enchantments)
- Technology and mysticism coexist without explanation
- Esperanto phrases appear as cultural markers
- References to "the nine" or other implied deities

## Writing Mechanics

- **Second person present tense** for immersion: "You look up at the
  interviewer"
- **Scene breaks with `---`** between major shifts
- **Code blocks that actually work** — the code is real, not pseudocode
- **Gradual reveal** of the protagonist's nature through small details (tail,
  dorsal fin, magick)
- **Deadpan supernatural elements** treated as mundane: "The magick took root
  and the 'Jeff' stopped thinking about it."
- **Punchline through understatement**: changing one number and declaring "It is
  now ten times faster."
