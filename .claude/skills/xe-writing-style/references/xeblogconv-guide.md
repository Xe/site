# XeblogConv / Conv Component Guide

The `<XeblogConv>` (also aliased as `<Conv>` and `<XesiteConv>`) component is Xe's signature **persona dialogue system**—a way to break up technical writing with conversational interludes featuring a cast of recurring characters.

## Quick Reference

```jsx
// Single message
<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Your message here. Can include **markdown**, [links](https://example.com), etc.
</XeblogConv>

// Multiple messages as a conversation (use ConvP parent wrapper)
<ConvP>
  <XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="enby">
    First message...
  </XeblogConv>
  <XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hacker">
    Response...
  </XeblogConv>
</ConvP>
```

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Ethical Framing / Ground Rules

**Open controversial posts with a blame-free zone:**

```jsx
<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="enby">
  This is going to be a bit of a rant. Please remember that we are not
  blaming anyone for the choices they made. Everyone did their best with
  the information they had.
</XeblogConv>
```

### 2. Technical Exposition (Mara's "Pro Tips")

**Have Mara provide additional technical context:**

```jsx
<Mara> is written to be the student in the Socratic dialogues. She has a fair amount of knowledge about technology, just enough to not be afraid to ask for clarification on how things fit into the larger picture or to call the teacher out for being vague or misleading.

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hacker">
  Terminology hint! An "instance" in waifud is the combination of a virtual
  machine, a base image, a machine to run it on, and finally a user-supplied
  cloud-init configuration.
</XeblogConv>
```

### 3. Foreshadowing / Meta-Commentary

**Numa provides narrative foreshadowing:**

```jsx
<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="smug">
  Foreshadowing is a narrative device in which a writer gives an advance hint
  of what is to come later in the story.
</XeblogConv>

(Then later something goes wrong)

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  I fucking told you.
</XeblogConv>
```

### 4. Breaking Up Long Explanations

**Use dialogue to create rhythm between dense technical sections:**

```jsx
[Long technical explanation...]

<XeblogConv name="Aoi" mood="facepalm">
  Wait, I don't get it. Why do we need _three_ different tools for this?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Great question! Each tool handles a different layer of the problem...
</XeblogConv>
```

### 5. Humor and Personality

**Insert levity during frustrating debugging:**

```jsx
<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="percussive-maintenance">
  Have you tried turning it off and on again?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  Have you tried turning it off and on again?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="sleepy">
  Have you tried turning it off and on again?
</XeblogConv>
```

### 6. AI-Generated Content Attribution

**Use Mimi with `aiModel` prop to show AI generation:**

```jsx
<XeblogConv name="Mimi" mood="happy" aiModel="Google Gemini 1.5 Pro">
  These show notes were generated using Google Gemini 1.5 Pro. Should this
  podcast take off, we'll find a better way to do this.
</XeblogConv>
```

### 7. Counterargument / Devil's Advocate

**Characters provide alternate perspectives:**

```jsx
<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="enby">
  I really think this approach is the way forward.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="concern">
  But won't this cause issues with X? What about when Y happens?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="facepalm">
  Oh, you're right. I hadn't considered that.
</XeblogConv>
```

### 8. Deep Lore / Tangents

**Mara provides context about the blog ecosystem:**

```jsx
<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hacker">
  Fun xe iaso dot net cinematic universe lore: The main YouTube channel
  associated with this blog is so old that it dates back to when YouTube let you
  set your own top-level URL off of YouTube.com. That channel's YouTube URL is
  youtube.com/shadowh511. The `shadowh` is a reference to Shadow the Hedgehog.
</XeblogConv>
```

### 9. Emotional Honesty / Vulnerability

**Cadey expresses frustration or burnout:**

```jsx
<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="angy">
  Everything sucks here. I've been debugging this for six hours and I just
  want it to work.
</XeblogConv>
```

### 10. Socratic Dialogue Format

**Teaching through Q&A between characters:**

```jsx
<ConvP>
  <XeblogConv name="Aoi" mood="sus">
    So why can't we just use a regular database for this?
  </XeblogConv>

  <XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
    Well, the problem is that we need to handle...
  </XeblogConv>

  <XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
    But couldn't we work around that by...?
  </XeblogConv>

  <XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="aha">
    Oh! That's actually a great idea. Let me explain why that works...
  </XeblogConv>
</ConvP>
```

## When to Use vs. Not Use

### ✅ Good Use Cases

| Scenario | Character | Mood |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Breaking up long technical sections | Any | Context-appropriate |
| Providing additional context | Mara | `hacker` |
| Expressing frustration | Cadey | `facepalm`, `angy` |
| Satirical commentary | Numa | `delet`, `smug` |
| Asking reader questions | Aoi | `facepalm`, `sus` |
| Explaining ethical stance | Cadey | `enby`, `coffee` |
| Attributing AI content | Mimi | `happy` + `aiModel` prop |

### ❌ Avoid

- **Overuse** - Not every paragraph needs a conversation break
- **Breaking flow** - Don't interrupt critical explanations mid-thought
- **Redundancy** - Don't repeat what the main text just said
- **Inside jokes without context** - If only you understand it, cut it
- **Forced humor** - If it doesn't naturally flow, don't force it

## Component Aliases

The component is registered under multiple names (all identical functionality):

- `<XeblogConv>` - Preferred, explicit
- `<Conv>` - Shorthand
- `<XesiteConv>` - Legacy name

The parent wrapper:
- `<ConvP>` - Wraps multiple `<XeblogConv>` for visual grouping

## Sticker URLs

Stickers are served from: `https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/{name}/{mood}`

Where `{name}` is the lowercase character name and `{mood}` is the mood string.

## Examples from Real Posts

### Setting Expectations (Satire Warning)

```jsx
<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="enby">
  This post is satire. Please do not actually do this in production unless you
  want to lose your job. This is a thought experiment, not architectural advice.
</XeblogConv>
```

### Technical Clarification

```jsx
<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hacker">
  You can also put values in contexts! See <a href="...">here</a> for more
  detail on how this works.
</XeblogConv>
```

### Personal Commentary

```jsx
<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Oh, and if I want a large language model integrated into my tower, I'm going
  to write the integration myself with the model running on hardware I can
  look at.
</XeblogConv>
```

## Summary

The XeblogConv system is **Xe's way of externalizing internal dialogue**—breaking the fourth wall to have conversations with different aspects of their own thinking process. Each character represents a different voice in the author's head:

- **Cadey** = The expert teacher (authorial voice)
- **Mara** = The curious student (learner/explicator)
- **Numa** = The cynic (satire/hot takes)
- **Aoi** = The idealist (audience surrogate)
- **Mimi** = The AI (meta-commentary on generation)

Used thoughtfully, these components create a distinctive, engaging style that makes technical writing feel like a conversation among friends.
