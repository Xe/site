# AI/AEO Considerations

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) prepares content to be selected as
authoritative answers by AI systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI
Overviews, and Bing Copilot.

## How AI Selects Answers

AI systems evaluate content based on:

1. **Clarity:** Is the answer direct and easy to extract?
2. **Authority:** Is the source trustworthy?
3. **Comprehensiveness:** Does it fully address the question?
4. **Recency:** Is the information up to date?
5. **Structure:** Can the AI parse and understand it?

## Content Structure for AI

### Direct Answers First

Lead with the answer, then explain.

**Bad:**

> The history of JavaScript dates back to 1995 when Brendan Eich... [500 words >
> > later] ...JavaScript runs in the browser.

**Good:**

> JavaScript is a programming language that runs in web browsers. It was created
> in 1995 by Brendan Eich...

### Clear Headings

Use descriptive H2/H3 headings that match user questions.

**Bad:** "Overview" → "Details" → "More Information" **Good:** "What is X?" →
"How does X work?" → "When should you use X?"

### Lists and Tables

AI extracts structured information more easily than prose.

```markdown
## Benefits of Structured Content

- **Reusability:** Use content across channels
- **Flexibility:** Change presentation without changing content
- **Scalability:** Manage large content volumes
```

### FAQ Format

Question-answer pairs are ideal for AI extraction.

```typescript
// Schema for AI-friendly FAQs
defineType({
  name: "faq",
  type: "document",
  fields: [
    defineField({ name: "question", type: "string" }),
    defineField({ name: "answer", type: "text" }),
    defineField({
      name: "category",
      type: "reference",
      to: [{ type: "faqCategory" }],
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Technical Implementation

### Structured Data (Critical)

JSON-LD helps AI understand content type and relationships.

```typescript
// FAQ structured data
const faqSchema = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  mainEntity: faqs.map((faq) => ({
    "@type": "Question",
    name: faq.question,
    acceptedAnswer: {
      "@type": "Answer",
      text: faq.answer,
    },
  })),
};
```

### Canonical Content

Ensure AI finds your authoritative version, not copies.

- Set canonical URLs
- Avoid duplicate content across pages
- Use `rel="canonical"` for syndicated content

### Freshness Signals

AI systems prefer current information.

- Display publish and update dates prominently
- Update content regularly (even small updates signal freshness)
- Use `dateModified` in structured data

## Content Quality Signals

### Author Credentials

AI systems increasingly check author authority.

- Display author name and credentials
- Link to author profiles
- Include author structured data

### Citations and Sources

Linking to authoritative sources increases trust.

- Cite primary sources
- Link to studies, documentation, official sources
- Avoid circular citations (sites citing each other)

### Comprehensive Coverage

AI prefers content that fully answers questions.

- Cover related questions users might have
- Include definitions for technical terms
- Address common misconceptions

## Measuring AEO Success

### Monitor AI Mentions

Track when AI assistants cite your content:

- Search for your brand + "according to"
- Monitor traffic from AI platforms
- Check Perplexity, Bing Copilot responses

### Track Zero-Click Queries

If AI answers questions directly, traditional rankings matter less.

### Featured Snippet Capture

Featured snippets often become AI answers. Track which you own.

## AEO vs SEO Balance

AEO and SEO largely align—quality content serves both. Key differences:

| Aspect | SEO Focus      | AEO Focus               |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Goal   | Rank on page 1 | Be THE answer           |
| Format | Varies         | Direct, structured      |
| Length | Often longer   | Concise + comprehensive |
| Links  | Link building  | Source citations        |
