# EEAT Principles

Google's EEAT framework (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness,
Trustworthiness) guides how content quality is evaluated. This applies to both
SEO rankings and AI answer selection.

## The Four Pillars

### Experience

First-hand or life experience with the topic.

**Signals:**

- Personal anecdotes and case studies
- "I tested this" content
- Real-world results and screenshots
- User-generated reviews

**Implementation:**

- Include author bios with relevant experience
- Add "About the Author" sections
- Feature customer testimonials
- Show real examples, not just theory

### Expertise

Knowledge and skill in the subject area.

**Signals:**

- Credentials and qualifications
- Depth of content coverage
- Technical accuracy
- Citations to authoritative sources

**Implementation:**

- Display author credentials
- Link to primary sources
- Cover topics comprehensively
- Keep content technically accurate and updated

### Authoritativeness

Recognition as a go-to source in the field.

**Signals:**

- Backlinks from respected sites
- Mentions in industry publications
- Social proof and follower counts
- Brand recognition

**Implementation:**

- Build thought leadership content
- Contribute to industry publications
- Maintain consistent publishing
- Develop recognizable brand voice

### Trustworthiness

Accuracy, transparency, and legitimacy.

**Signals:**

- Clear authorship and contact info
- Accurate, fact-checked content
- Secure website (HTTPS)
- Privacy policy and terms

**Implementation:**

- Display clear author attribution
- Include publication and update dates
- Provide contact information
- Use HTTPS and maintain security

## Sanity Implementation

```typescript
// Author schema with EEAT signals
defineType({
  name: "author",
  type: "document",
  fields: [
    defineField({ name: "name", type: "string" }),
    defineField({ name: "role", type: "string" }),
    defineField({ name: "bio", type: "text" }),
    defineField({
      name: "credentials",
      type: "array",
      of: [{ type: "string" }],
    }),
    defineField({ name: "image", type: "image" }),
    defineField({
      name: "socialLinks",
      type: "array",
      of: [
        {
          type: "object",
          fields: [
            defineField({ name: "platform", type: "string" }),
            defineField({ name: "url", type: "url" }),
          ],
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});

// Content with EEAT metadata
defineType({
  name: "post",
  fields: [
    defineField({
      name: "author",
      type: "reference",
      to: [{ type: "author" }],
    }),
    defineField({ name: "publishedAt", type: "datetime" }),
    defineField({ name: "updatedAt", type: "datetime" }),
    defineField({
      name: "reviewedBy",
      type: "reference",
      to: [{ type: "author" }],
      description: "Expert reviewer for fact-checking",
    }),
    defineField({
      name: "sources",
      type: "array",
      of: [{ type: "url" }],
      description: "Citations and references",
    }),
  ],
});
```

## YMYL Considerations

"Your Money or Your Life" topics (health, finance, legal, safety) require extra
EEAT rigor:

- Medical content reviewed by healthcare professionals
- Financial advice from certified experts
- Legal content reviewed by attorneys
- Clear disclaimers where appropriate
