  This page is a blog post by Xe, a Developer Advocate at Tailscale. It
  describes how to install Tailscale on a Steam Deck, a handheld Linux computer
  for playing PC games. The article explains the challenges and solutions of
  installing Tailscale on SteamOS, a variant of Arch Linux that runs on the
  Steam Deck. The article also demonstrates some of the use cases of Tailscale
  on the Steam Deck, such as remote-mounting a NAS, hosting game servers, and
  streaming games from another PC. The article concludes with some previews of a
  Steam Deck plugin that Xe is working on to automate the Tailscale setup. The
  article is intended for gamers and Linux enthusiasts who want to use Tailscale
  on their Steam Deck or other devices.
