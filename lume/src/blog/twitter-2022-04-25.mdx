So a lot of things happened today. The threat that Elon Musk made to
buy Twitter seems to have been true. As I write this, my current
understanding is that the Twitter board of directors is in the process
of accepting the offer that Elon Musk to buy the company.

  This was not on my bingo card for 2022. I'm starting to think that I got a dud
  bingo card. I was hoping that "Alien Invasion" would win out but it looks like
  that won't be the case yet. Damn.

I genuinely have no idea how I should be reacting to this news. I
spend a lot of time on Twitter. It's a lot of how I talk with people,
network in the tech community and generally shitpost. I do so much
idle shitposting on Twitter that it would probably count for a lot of
the non-work written word I produce on a weekly basis.

I'm really not sure what I feel about this, but the feelings that I am
getting remind me of [what happened to
freenode](/blog/series/freenode). A while ago someone I follow on
Twitter made a tweet that said something like:

> Elon Musk is to Twitter as rasengan is to freenode

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hacker">
  For context: rasengan is the person that single-handedly destroyed freenode by
  apparently buying a worthless holding company and then inciting a lot of
  drama. For more information, check out the book Closed Projects.

  I have made my book [Closed Projects](/blog/closed-projects-2022-03-24) free
  for the next week. This contains my moods, reactions and emotions as I was
  processing everything falling apart around me. I feel this may help you
  understand the emotions that you get watching this shitshow unfold with
  Twitter.

I am also on Mastodon at
[@cadey@pony.social](https://pony.social/@cadey). Should something
happen to Twitter such that I can't participate there anymore, I will
be on Mastodon. If Twitter really starts falling apart, I will
probably be a lot more active on Mastodon. And probably writing a lot
more.

Let's hope things turn out well.
