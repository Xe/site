## Introduction

`h` is a conlang project that I have been working off and on for years. It is infinitely simply teachable, trivial to master and can be used to represent the entire scope of all meaning in any facet of the word. All with a single character.

This is a continuation from [this post](https://xeiaso.net/blog/the-origin-of-h-2015-12-14). If this post makes sense to you, please let me know and/or schedule a psychologist appointment just to be safe.

## Phonology

`h` has only one consonant phoneme, [`/h/`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_glottal_fricative). This is typically not used as `h` is mostly a written language. Some people may pronounce it `aych`, which is equally as valid and intelligible. The Lojbanic h `'` is also acceptable.

### Consonant Chart

|                        | Laryngeal |
| :--------------------- | :-------- |
| Non-sibilant fricative | `/h/`     |

## Grammar

`h` has only one valid word, "h". It is used as follows:

```
<Cadey> h
<Dorito> h
```

This demonstrates a conversation between Cadey and Dorito about the implications of the bigger picture of software development and how current trends are risking a collapse of the human experiment.

As noted before, adding more "h" to a single sentence reduces the scope of meaning. Here is an example:

```
<Cadey> h
<DoesntGetIt> h h h h
* Cadey facepalms
```

Cadey opened with a treatise on the state of reality. DoesntGetIt decided it was a good idea to reply with a recipe for chocolate chip cookies. The conversation was lost in translation.

### Peg Grammar

```
H = h+seperator+
seperator = space+h
space = ' '
h = 'h' / "'"
```
