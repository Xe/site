  This page is a blog post by Xe, a Developer Advocate at Tailscale. It compares
  and contrasts Tailscale with Hamachi, a tool that Xe used in college to play
  games with friends over a shared network. The article highlights how Tailscale
  is an evolution of the concepts that Hamachi introduced, such as firewall hole
  punching, relay servers, and private IP addresses. The article also shows how
  Tailscale adds more features and benefits than Hamachi, such as identity-based
  access control, HTTPS certificates, MagicDNS, Tailscale SSH, and support for
  more platforms and OSes. The article concludes with some examples of how
  Tailscale can be used to build the next generation of shared game worlds,
  internal applications, and more. The article is intended for people who are
  familiar with Hamachi or want to learn more about Tailscale.
