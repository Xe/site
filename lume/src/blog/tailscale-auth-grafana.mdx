  This page demonstrates how to use Tailscale to simplify the authentication and
  access control for internal services such as Grafana. It shows how to use a
  local API server and a proxy to pass the Tailscale user information to Grafana
  via HTTP headers. It also explains how to configure Grafana and the proxy, and
  how to restrict access to Grafana only over Tailscale. The benefits of this
  approach are reduced provisioning work, improved security, and seamless
  integration with existing identity providers.
