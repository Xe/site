    This post is outdated, see <a href="/salary-transparency">here</a> for more
    context on why this data is made public. The table on this page will be
    automatically updated to contain the data on my salary transparency page,
    but you should prefer that page over this one when possible.

Let this be inspiration to whoever is afraid of trying, failing and being fired.
Every single one of these jobs has taught me lessons I've used daily in my
career.

## First Jobs

I don't have exact dates on these, but my first jobs were:

- Grocery Bagger - early-mid high school
- Pizza Delivery Driver - late high school early college
- Paper Grader - Fall quarter of 2012

I ended up walking out on the delivery job, but that's a story for another day.

Most of what I learned from these jobs were the value of labor and when to just
shut up and give people exactly what they are asking for. Even if it's what they
might not want.

## Salaried Jobs

The following table is a history of my software career by title, date and salary
(company names are omitted).

  While modernizing part of my site and lifting common code into crates, I was
  no longer able to embed this data into this page itself. This page has a
  better home [here](/salary-transparency). Sorry for this, I had no other
  option.
</XeblogConv>

Even though I've been fired three times, I don't regret my career as it's been
thus far. I've been able to work on experimental technology integrating into
phone systems. I've worked in a mixed PHP/Haskell/Erlang/Go/Perl production
environment. I've literally rebuilt most of the tool that was catalytic to my
career a few times over. It's been the ride of a lifetime.

Even though I was fired, each of these failures in this chain of jobs enabled me
to succeed the way I have. I can't wait to see what's next out of it. I only
wonder how I can be transformed even more. I really wonder what it's gonna be
like with the company that hired me over the border.

Please go out and try, Creator. Go for your larger dreams of success. Inaction
is a lot easier to regret than action is.

Be well.

If you can, please make a blogpost similar to this. Don't include company names.
Include start date, end date, time spent there, time spent job hunting, salary
(if you remember it) and how you left it. Let's
[end salary secrecy](https://web.archive.org/web/20190403165849/https://thegirlpowercode.com/2018/09/12/is-salary-secrecy-coming-to-an-end/)
one step at a time.
