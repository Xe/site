The following is the results of both blind googling and brute forcing the keyboard space. If this is incomplete, please let me know so that can be fixed.

| Accent/Ligature | How to type | Example  |
| :-------------- | :---------- | :------  |
| é (acute)       | Alt-e       | entrée   |
| è (grave)       | Alt-`       | fières   |
| ï (umlat)       | Alt-u       | naïve    |
| ç (cedelia)     | Alt-c       | français |
| œ (oe ligature) | Alt-q       | œuf      |
| û (circumflex)  | Alt-i       | hôtel    |
| « (left quote)  | Alt-\\      | «salut!» |
| » (right quote) | Alt-Shift-\\ | «salut!» |

You can also type a forward facing accent on most arbitrary characters by typing it and then pressing Alt-Shift-e. Circumflêxes can be done postfix with Alt-Shift-i too. Thís dóesńt work on every letter, unfortunately. However it does work for enough of them. Not enough for Esperanto's `ĉu` however.
