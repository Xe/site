  Don't. Seriously don't. I have net negative interest in them and will actively
  waste your time to avoid you scamming some sorry sucker out of their sanity
  and hope for the future. The only blockchain I'm excited to work with is Git.
  Do not try to convince me that scamcoin is the next coming of sliced bread. Go
  buy furry art from actual artists instead of white nationalist monkeys.
</XeblogConv>

As a side effect of my blog's apparent popularity, I get a lot of people from
many different backgrounds contacting me asking me if I want to work with them
or for their company. These are almost always turned down, but recently I had an
interaction with someone trying to shill a job at me that was so transparently
bad that I feel I should sub-blog them.

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  Sub-blogging? Is that like sub-tweeting but in longform?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Yes, it's a thing. Several posts on this site are sub-blogging examples. Won't
  tell which ones.
</XeblogConv>

Usually you can tell what way these things are going to go by the subject line.
Here's the subject line that I got yesterday:

> Blockchain company I am applying to

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Oh boy.
</XeblogConv>

And here's the body ([emphasis] mine):

> I am applying to work for [scammers] on his blockchain projects and came
> across your projects and ideas and you are someone I would want to work with,
> thus I am telling you about this job I am applying for. Here is the original
> job post tweet: [LINK EXPUNGED] with the corrected description below.

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  Is this a recruiter?
</XeblogConv>

> I like that you have a variety of projects in a variety of languages

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  Totally reads like a recruiter.
</XeblogConv>

> Are you good at @golang? Want to make $175,000 a year? Speak good English? I
> want to hire you. Remote. Blockchain software all sucks. We're making it suck
> less. [We want to fork the Go Ethereum server], porting this to [buzzword]
> after mainnet launch. Direct message me [on Telegram] or email me (I hate
> email) at [LINK EXPUNGED] I'll give you a 15 minute test to filter out the

> Wallet: replace metamask (electron app for cross platform). Uniswap but across
> chains. More bridges: to start, then btc, bnb, bch, in that order. Network:
> pulsechain. Uniswap v3 front end. Stablecoin from my exchange I'm making.
> Aggregator: replace [waste of human effort] market orders and limit orders.

> Look forward to hearing from you and possibly working with you.

> Thank You,

> [NAME EXPUNGED]

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  What the hell is that? That's a bunch of "sentences" that seemingly have no
  real understandable quality to them. It reads like an AI took every scamcoin
  tweet and SEO blog and threw it in a blender with GPT-3 and laundry sauce,
  then someone prompted it with "Blockchain software all sucks. We're making it
  suck less." and hoped it made sense.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="happy">
  Maybe this person isn't a native English speaker, we should at least be
  charitable as to what they're saying in order to avoid pissing people off. Not
  like we want to take this job anyways...
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  I'm with the raging side here. This is hardly understandable, even more since
  I only know enough about scamcoin to know I never want to associate with it.
  This is transparently someone trying to drum up hype in a product that doesn't
  exist yet by claiming to be a peer so that it looks like they're more
  trustable.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  Yeah, this is so transparently an advertisement. Who the hell contacts someone
  out of the blue letting them know about a job _they applied for_ without there
  being some kind of financial motivation for the person doing the contact?
  Maybe we could work a reading comprehension test in there too for shits and
  giggles!

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  Why add that thing about being paid in US dollars?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  If you don't add that the scamcoin people will offer to pay you exclusively in
  scamcoin!
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="wat">
  Why would they do that? Shouldn't a job you apply to pay you in real money?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  A sucker's born every minute. Plus it's trivial for them to spin up a billion
  memecoins out of nothing in a project this early in the game despite what they
  claim about being able to print money out of nowhere being impossible in
  scamcoin spaces.
</XeblogConv>

Some time later:

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  lol we got a reply:
</XeblogConv>

> Wow, you didn't peruse what I wrote, I am a software engineer who is applying
> for the same position I wrote to you about. I don't work for [scam artist] or
> [proper noun], yet. Thanks for replying though

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  Sure you are. That makes sense that you as a software engineer applying for
  jobs would try to drum up hype in a company you don't even work for yet. THAT
  MAKES SENSE!!!
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  Didn't we do that with Tailscale though, even if just a little?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
Fair, but that was different, Tailscale actually has a product that isn't
related to making people think they own a jpeg with funny money that you used to
be able to use to buy drugs with.

This looks like a great place to bring out the idiot fee. Draft ho!

</XeblogConv>

> Ah, in that case my fee is 1.2 million dollars per year in salary.
> Thank you for understanding.

There was no reply.

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  No fun, this could have been even more amusing!
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
If you are going to try to shill a scamcoin job _to a writer_, please at least
put some effort into the wording you use. So many people have been trained to
assume that dodgy English = blatant scam.

Also I am happy with my current job, so you won't really be able to get me over anyways.
