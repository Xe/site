This recipe was made up by me and my fiancé. We just sorta winged it every time
we made it until we found something that was easy to cook and tasty. We make
this every week or so.

## Recipe

### Ingredients

- Pack of 4 chicken breasts
- A fair amount of Montreal seasoning (garlic, onion, salt, oregano)
- 3 cups basmati rice
- 3.75 cups water
- 1/4th bag of frozen stir fry vegetables
- Avocado/coconut oil
- Standard frying pan
- Standard chef's knife
- Standard 11x14 cutting board
- Two metal bowls
- Instant Pot
- Spatula

### Seasoning

Put the seasoning in one of the bowls and unwrap the plastic around the chicken
breasts. Take each chicken breast out of the package (you may need to cut them
free of eachother, use a sharp knife for that) and rub all sides of it around in
the seasoning. 

Put these into the other metal bowl and when you've done all four, cover with
plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 5-6 hours.

Doing this helps to have the chicken soak up the flavor of the seasoning so it
tastes better when you cook it.

### Cooking

Slice two chicken breasts up kinda like
[this](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/04/knife-skills-how-to-slice-chicken-breast-for-stir-fries.html)
and then transfer to the heated pan with oil in it. Cook those and flip them
every few minutes until you've cooked everything all the way through (random
sampling by cutting a bit of chicken in half with the spatula and seeing if it's
overly juicy or not is a good way to tell, or if you have a food thermometer to
165 degrees fahrenheit or 75 degrees celsius). Put this chicken into a plastic
container for use in other meals (it goes really good on sandwiches).

Then repeat the slicing and cooking for the last two chicken breasts. However,
this time put _half_ of the chicken into the plastic container you used before
(about one chicken breast worth in total, it doesn't have to be exact). At the
same time as the second round of chicken is cooking, put about 3 cups of rice
and 3.75 cups of water into the instant pot; then seal it and set it to manual
for 4 minutes.

Dump frozen vegetables on top of the remainder of the chicken and stir until the
vegetables are warm.

### Serving

Serve the stir fry hot on a bed of rice.
