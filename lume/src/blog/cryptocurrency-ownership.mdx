I have picked a hell of a time to experiment with Ethereum. In general, I've been trying to figure out for myself if the whole blockchain scene is something that is actually worth the scorn and toxicity I've had for it for so long. This technology is _really neat_ from a technical standpoint, but being a cool nerd toy and a viable product for the masses are polar opposites. Especially when money is involved.

I want to start out by saying that I am not a neutral party here. I have been anti-blockchain [to the point of toxicity](https://xeiaso.net/blog/trying-to-use-security-token) for a long time. I have also been harmed by the [Mt. Gox exit scam](https://moneybadger.stocktwits.com/history-of-mt-gox-bitcoin/). When that happened, I was in college. My father was paying a lot of my college tuition by selling the Bitcoin he had mined back when the project was brand new and CPU mining was viable (I think he mined like 4 blocks or something). He used Mt. Gox to exchange that Bitcoin for USD to pay the school. The exit scam happened while I was at college. Thankfully it didn't happen just before one of the quarter due dates, but I'm pretty sure it was a large part of the reason why I ended up having to drop out of college. That and unmedicated ADHD, but that's a story for another day.

In the past, I have been toxic to people doing blockchain stuff out of that past trauma re-emerging. I've needlessly cut off friendships. I don't want to be known for toxicity anymore. As part of this healing process, I've been trying to _actually understand_ this technology so I can figure out if this technology is worth using or not. I don't want to rely on other people's understanding anymore. If I do eventually conclude that there is something there, I'm willing to admit that I was wrong. This is part two of my magical blockchain journey. You can read the first part [here](https://xeiaso.net/blog/trying-to-use-security-token) or see the entire series [here](https://xeiaso.net/blog/series/ethereum).

  Hi! I’m Open, the technical editor for this blog. Usually I’m in the
  background rather than the article itself. I’m working with Xe on a Nix flakes
  post which was supposed to be the first one I formally co-author, but I had
  some Thoughts about this topic so I’m jumping in here.
</XeblogConv>

Today I want to investigate the ways Ethereum was sold to _me_, my thoughts on them as I've been researching things, and some of the other philosophical points of cryptocurrency in general that are worth consideration. As another one of the biases I have going into this, I would love to use something like Ethereum to be able to pay for commissioning art without having to worry about payment processors like PayPal canceling accounts for that art being erotica. Ideally, I'd like to be able to give the artist cash, but that doesn't work so well when the only contact I have with them is over the Internet.

It would be nice if there were other uses too, but really the big selling point in my book is the ability to make payments to people without a payment processor being able to say "no" and ban you because you want something perfectly legal that makes puritans squirm (such as erotica).

I would love for my past assumptions about the technology to be proven wrong. If everything pans out like they think it will, that could be great. Keywords _could_ and _if_.

## The promises I was told

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Subjectivity warning: remember that I am talking about the things _I
  personally_ was promised as assets to the cryptocurrency space and/or reasons
  why I should care about this at all. This is subjective. Your experiences can
  and will be different.
</XeblogConv>

When the web3 people have tried to sell me on the web3 stuff they've been working on, they usually focus on these high level things:

- Peer-to-peer payments without a payment processor or a bank being able to say "lol no"
- Anonymous payments, so that I have privacy the same way that I'd have if using cash
- Unfakeable "ownership" of arbitrary tokens so that I can prove that I have things like furry OCs or the "right to use a closed species"
- Distributed computing, so that I can make additional bits of code run to validate things involving my presence on the blockchain, create arbitrary tokens (fungible and non-fungible) and more
- Being able to use your hat or avatar in another game through blockchain cross-pollination of assets

To be honest, this is a huge thing, and if even the first one is viable then it
means that I can have less fear about making transactions on the Internet. I
could use this to commission art, help friends meet rent when they land on hard
times, and not have to worry about someone changing their name on all of their
paperwork everywhere all at once so that we can send money to each other. I
could just send them money to their Ethereum addresses. They could just send
money to `xeiaso.eth` or `0xeA223Ca8968Ca59e0Bc79Ba331c2F6f636A3fB82`.
Everything will work as normal.

<div class="warning">
  <XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
    Due to how this all is designed, anyone can send anything into anyone's

</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Yeah. This is where the golden promised future of cryptocurrency starts
  falling apart. It's like US dollars in a way. You can only use US dollars with
  people that accept US dollars as payment. You can only use Ethereum with
  people that accept Ethereum as payment. There's a huge network effect at play
  here, and in order to have any cryptocurrency become a viable means of
  payment, you have to play the massive uphill game of trying to establish a
  network effect of your own. Ideally you want taking Ethereum to be _easier_
  than taking US dollars. Guess what isn't the case.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="wave">
  For me, the whole dance of paying someone for content on the internet is…
  rough. Like, there are so many steps to pay someone, and everyone wants to
  send me emails or sign me up for a subscription to pay every month for premium
  content, and I need to scroll around the page to find a payment link then go
  through multiple forms and find my credit card to enter the number or sign
  into paypal or whatever. I’d really like to be able to just like… hey, this
  research you published for free on your blog is excellent and saved me like
  three hours of trying to put it together from other sources. One click, you
  get a dollar, thank you very much, I’ll be on my way. And on the other hand,
  I’d like to be able to have something like that which is trivial to set up on
  my own content rather than needing advertisement peering and accounts and
  having a minimum payout before I can use the money, and annoying all the
  viewers…
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="enby">
  Amazingly enough, a lot of this is actually solved in Canada provided the
  person or business you're trying to send money to has a bank account. You can
  use [Interac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interac) to send money to people
  by phone number or email address. It's how I've paid my tax attorney and for a
  while it's how I've paid rent. This is only viable for bigger payments though,
  something like [micropayments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment)
  have never really taken off because of transaction fees, especially with
  cryptocurrencies. Litecoin has [very low transaction
  fees](https://litecoin.info/index.php/Transaction_fees), but if your total
  payment is a dollar then a 4% transaction fee sounds kind of ludicrous. If
  things like [Stellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_(payment_network))
  were more viable, then it would be a different story.
  <br />
  <br />
  Until then we'll be dealing with Twitch only paying out once you make $100 or my
  advertising provider only paying out when you make $50. It's a nightmare.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="stare">
  Wait, wait. One of the original points in the bitcoin paper was that it would
  avoid paying transaction fees to the bigger banks. When you pay a transaction
  fee on a cryptocurrency payment, where does it go? The miners/stakers?
  Wouldn't that just end up making you pay the transaction fees to the bigger
  players anyways?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Yep. Stay tuned for why.
</XeblogConv>

In practice, these promises don't pan out as easily as they sound. You actually do need middlemen. A lot of them, especially if you want to pay rent or buy food with that money. You'll need to register with one of many "exchanges" which may or may not have the best security practices while at the same time demanding copies of your ID documents so they can comply with "know your customer" laws. That seems safe.

You can send payments to artists to commission art with Ethereum, but the main problem there is that transactions on the blockchain aren't reversible in cases of fraud. It seems that the Ethereum people are of the standpoint that the technology of the blockchain and the cryptosystem make fraud categorically impossible in Ethereum land. This is...a take, but in general I can kind of see what they are going for. Reversibility of transactions is usually a byproduct of the traditional financial system having middlemen that can make calls like "yeah this person was out of line" and then undo the transaction (and even restrict the account of the perpetrator) so the victim has an easier time and they can reduce the amount of fraud on their network.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="snug">
  It’s not just a middleman making a call that the person was out of line, it’s
  that the traditional financial system has the traditional legal system with
  the ability to go after someone who committed fraud or theft and force them to
  pay the money back afterwards (at least in theory). That ability is what
  enables payment processors to offer payment protection features, without being
  escrow agencies. And it also means that the middlemen aren’t required for that
  protection, because individuals can sue for payment fraud or theft. The US
  Bill of Rights guarantees the right to a lawsuit with trial by jury when more
  than $20 is in question, and anyone can file a suit; the middlemen just have
  the ability to threaten to stop providing payments for all customers if the
  disputed payment isn’t returned, the staff and premade forms that make it very
  easy for them to file such suits when necessary, and enough money to absorb
  chance without difficulty. And it’s not like reversing a transaction is
  *impossible* in Ethereum, but it’s a lot harder, to the point that the very
  few times it has ever happened were ecosystem-altering events.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  So this ecosystem where payments are irreversible by design has sometimes had
  the community come together to reverse payments they thought were fraudulent?
  Seems legit...
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="idle">
  Yep! And we can talk about the story there later! It’s interesting. Anyways,
  there is some stuff to deal with fraud on Ethereum without the… events, like
  Kleros, which provides a decentralized anonymous trial-by-jury approach to
  dealing with disputes. It could, theoretically, be integrated with a kind of
  escrow system where both parties pay into a contract that releases their
  payment/item after a set time or depending on the judgment of a dispute, but
  if anyone has done this, it is certainly not widespread enough for most
  transactions to have that kind of security. Also, it adds complexity to the
  transaction, meaning more gas is required to perform it, which means the
  transaction costs more. Whether or not it costs more than a credit card’s
  overhead we’ll have to look at later, because we need more concepts before we
  can go through the math to see how much transactions cost.
</XeblogConv>

In Ethereum land, identity is determined by being able to sign messages with a private key. Ownership of that private key gives you ownership of the wallet, and by extension everything _in_ that wallet. The entire system is based on the assumption that humans can keep track of private keys and keep them safe. Without backing them up on things like iCloud, Google Drive, Amazon S3, or any other online storage system. People usually suggest you put a backup copy of your recovery phrases (private keys) on paper (written in pencil, because apparently pen ink fades over longer periods of time) inside a safety deposit box. This is surely easy for people that are more affluent, but for ordinary people that is an extra $40 per month fee, which can be more than twice what an account fee is for normal checking accounts.

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  It would be fine if these processes encouraged the use of splitting and
  backing up keys in ways that align with best practices across the industry,
  but they don't. They suggest putting the entire keys to your digital kingdom
  into a single safety deposit box. There are devices that allow you to do
  hardware escrow of cryptocurrency private keys, but again they still encourage
  you to back up the key on paper. They also act like safety deposit boxes are
  free. They are not. They are expensive.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="idle">
  Ok, but “best practices across the industry” are kinda shitty in a lot of
  places.
</XeblogConv>

Ethereum addresses are anonymous.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="idle">
  More like pseudonymous.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Okay, granted, but Ethereum addresses are 160 bit values that are not
  fundamentally a human's name.
</XeblogConv>

However, transactions you make with those addresses are _not_ hidden. You can look at the [entire transaction history of any account you want](https://etherscan.io/address/0xea223ca8968ca59e0bc79ba331c2f6f636a3fb82), which makes choosing targets for phishing attacks trivial. If you can associate a person with an address, you can know what they use their money with. You can figure out how much of a target they are to you. If your identity gets tied to the wrong address, that address is blown and you need to potentially abandon that wallet and start over with a new one.

And then, of course there are the one-two punch of smart contracts and non-fungible tokens. I don't feel confident talking about smart contracts yet, so I'm going to defer talking about them until a later article. But let's take a look at non-fungible tokens a bit closer. Those are fun.

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  Fun…how?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="snug">
  I can talk about smart contracts though, and you do kinda need to know what a
  smart contract is to know what an NFT is, because smart contracts are what
  give NFTs meaning, to the extent they have meaning at all. After all, it's all
  just bits, and bits don't have color.

## Non-fungible tokens, CS:GO knife skins and furry art

/>

[Non-fungible tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) are little bits of data that signify that some wallet has some bit of data. This data is not able to be forged and is independently verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain. There is insufficient court precedent to know what having an NFT associated with your cryptocurrency address actually means, but to give people the benefit of the doubt I'm going to assume that you own the _token itself_, not any of the data associated with it such as images.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="snug">
  What does "owning the token" mean though? Ultimately all ownership must come
  down to some form of exclusion. In order to say that you own something you
  must have some way to say that someone else can't do something because they
  don't own it. Some NFT people try to say things like that owning the NFT
  provides an exclusive right to… have the image saved on your device? Which is
  spectacularly stupid. The asset linked to in a NFT lives on the original
  creators' hard drive, and people don't claim (as far as I've seen) that the
  creator must immediately delete their own copy of it once the NFT sells.
  Additionally, most NFT assets are hosted on IPFS, which specifically,
  deliberately, by its very operation, copies the asset to many different
  storage devices as people retrieve and pin it. Most browsers store temporary
  caches of every image they retrieve to speed up page loads. This criticism of
  NFTs actually made me anti-anti-crypto for a while. "Haha, we're going to
  right click and save your NFT" just seems like such a spectacularly stupid
  criticism of the system that it couldn't possibly connect to any real person
  that was willing to put down money on an immature technological R&D effort;
  surely the people making that claim are acting in bad faith, right? Right?
</XeblogConv>

</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="snug">
  Turns out, nope. NFT people got really upset about people doing that, and
  tried to coin "right-clickers" as a derogatory term and threatened IP
  litigation for privately downloading publicly posted content deliberately made
  available for download. And seeing that happen, seeing people I thought
  couldn't exist, that talking about them had to be in bad faith, come out of
  the woodwork and turn out to be either the majority of the community or
  actively exploited and scammed by people pretending to believe that in bad
  faith, is what made me realize that NFTs are doomed to uselessness. Even if I
  can show that there are particular sets of useful and pro-social desiderata
  that can only be solved by something isomorphic to NFTs, such a system can't
  be built because they're incompatible with modern humans.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  This really sucks to be honest. Something like this could give us a lot of
  freedom when it comes to designing and implementing things. Such a
  decentralized data store could make it a lot easier to import art around.
  Imagine if you could fire up your VR home world and the paintings on the
  virtual walls were automatically lit up with the images attached to NFTs you
  own. Something where you could easily move all that data around to different
  applications. This is a nice _vision_, but there is a huge difference between
  a _vision_ and a viable product. It would be really cool to have an e-ink
  screen that could be used to show off digital art, but I don't really see this
  happening unless that screen is sabotaged to only show off NFT art. I'm pretty
  sure that people don't want to see the horrific abominations that are [mutant
  apes](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club) (the sad results of
  overconsumption of slurp juices). This kind of a vision of the future is the
  kind of thing you only see in Zuckerberg keynotes, not actual viable things
  that can exist in this capitalist hellscape we live in.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="snug">
  Anyways, moving on from the rant, the most basic thing that owning an NFT
  gives you is bragging rights. You own the NFT, and others don't, so you get to
  brag about owning the NFT and others don't. Anything beyond that is modular
  and separate. For example, something that NFTs can and have been used for is
  tickets to an event; proving that you have a ticket cryptographically means
  that you can walk into the event, and it might arguably be superior to current
  ticket mechanisms in some ways, like allowing secondary resales in a
  guaranteed way. With physical tickets, you need to carry around a collection
  of physical things that could get shuffled around or dropped. Current
  electronic tickets, you are emailed a QR code that you can back up and save
  however you please, making it resistant to getting lost. However, you can't
  reliably resell an electronic ticket, because the seller still has the QR code
  and might get in line before you, thus invalidating the sale after the fact.
  On the one hoof, this means that you can recover money even if the event has a
  bad refund policy; on the other hoof it means people can scalp tickets
  readily.

### Steam inventory

This is similar to the Steam inventory system. This lets you have items from games like Team Fortress 2 (TF2, a once widely popular war-themed hat simulator) show up in a global inventory. This lets other people on Steam see what special items or hats you have so they can trade them with you.

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="enby">
  The "mannconomy" in TF2 enabled me to buy games on the cheap during Steam
  sales while I was a starving college student. I used to have a couple virtual
  machines set up to run TF2 in separate accounts while I was in class. These
  virtual machines would continuously idle in specially set up maps and collect
  random weapon drops with an autohotkey loop. These weapons were then traded to
  me to turn into refined metal, which I used to sell for lootbox keys, which I
  then used to sell for money on PayPal so I could buy games. I don't expect
  this to be viable anymore with the [collapse of the
  "mannconomy"](https://www.thegamer.com/team-fortress-2-economy-collapse-hats/)
  after valuable hats got duplicated and caused hyperinflation of the refined
  metal to key ratio. I got a bunch of games that way though.
</XeblogConv>

Realistically: TF2, [CS:GO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) and [DotA 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) are the only games that really take full advantage of this system. It never really caught on outside of games that Valve made.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="wave">
  What about, to pick some random examples, Redout: Enhanced Edition, Space
  Engineers, Battle block Theater, Don't Starve Together…
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Okay, granted, but how many of these games were there? And how many of those
  games are really that popular? Trading cards don't count, I can't use my Steam
  trading cards in games.

</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Ok, but there was never a cross-pollination of items in one game being usable
  in another, right? You couldn't take your custom knife skin in CS:GO into DotA
  2 to use on Bloodseeker's blades. You can't take your "Strange" TF2 hats into
  CS:GO so your counter-terrorist squad can be dripped out and fly. Each item
  really stayed in their own world. It was great for trading items though. Steam
  support even used to be able to reverse transactions if you got scammed.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="wave">
  What about Garry's Mod? What about all the hats that are wearable in both TF2
  and Portal 2, or the other cosmetics that you get in Portal 2 from other
  games?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="facepalm">
  Right, those. Honestly the fact that it's not a hugely memorable feature
  should be a sign that it's not a market demand. And we're not even talking
  about the difficulty of putting arbitrary assets into arbitrary engines yet.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="idle">
  I’ll grant you that the Portal 2 crossover hats are forgettable (I had to look
  it up to make sure I wasn’t misremembering (and I was in fact misremembering
  some things)), but not Garry’s Mod (gmod). Garry’s Mod’s ability to use assets
  from any Source engine game the user has purchased on Steam is a huge selling
  point. It’s prominently advertised and widely used, though it does suffer
  somewhat from requiring the consumer to own a license to the games the assets
  come from rather than the games implicitly coming with a license to distribute
  the assets for use in gmod maps, but it’s understandable why they don’t; that
  would be a kinda thorny IP case to try to navigate, and it would reduce the
  incentives people would have to buy your game.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="enby">
  True, Garry's Mod is why I ended up buying Counter Strike Source. I have no
  interest in playing Counter Strike but I was tired of seeing error objects and
  black/magenta textures everywhere. Oh god that texture is an _eyesore_.
</XeblogConv>

It's also widely understood that having a hat, weapon skin, announcer voice, or whatnot in your Steam inventory didn't mean you _owned the intellectual property_ of that item. You just had a unique copy of it in your inventory, much like having a Pokemon card didn't mean you owned the concept of Pikachu.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="snug">
  Oh, another thing. SteamVR Home has a lot of interesting ways to obtain
  assets. It has scavenger hunts for official assets that encourage exploring a
  variety of worlds to see what the system has to offer, ways to win them in
  minigames, workshop integration for sharing user generated content, etc. But
  the things that are relevant to the topic at hand are that it has collectibles
  you can find in other games and decorate your virtual room or your “avatar”,
  such as it is. For example, I can put on a mask from Payday 2 in SteamVR
  because once upon a time some people promised me it was a good party
  experience and babysat/coached me through a few high level missions. I can
  line up a figurine of atlas from portal 2 next to an enemy from super hot, and
  shoot at them with a little remote controlled drone I won in a shooting range
  minigame. There are only about 70-80 games on Steam that actually provide
  SteamVR Collectibles, but that’s very different from zero. And of course,
  these items are just things in the Steam inventory so you can trade them.
  Also, you can bring Steam achievements from any game in as 3d trophies you can
  put in a virtual shelf or trophy case.

### Furry "adoptables" and "closed species"

The furry fandom's social norms are a bit weird to outsiders. One of the big things that people have trouble with is the fact that there's no actual "source material" for the furry fandom. It's entirely self-standing and dates back to cartoonists wanting to draw funny animals. There's no real cohesive universe for the furry fandom, but we all like to pretend there is for our own collective amusement.

One of the things you will see people do in the furry fandom is create their own Original Characters (OCs). The rationale for these can boil down to a number of things, including roleplay, characters to use in fiction, sexual fantasies, an idealized version of the self, or any number of other things you can do with characters. For example, here's a shark typing on a split keyboard that you've seen before:

<XeblogSticker name="Mara" mood="hacker"></XeblogSticker>

I use these characters to help me illustrate side ideas, internal disagreements, and more on this blog. This cast of characters helps me use common tropes to portray ideas like "the student that always wants to learn more", "the author self-insert", or "the ruthless shitposter that really does mean well". I can also use them to have guests peek into the article and give their own input.

Most people end up creating their own characters out of their own hopes, ambitions, and dreams (such as the black-tipped reef shark on the blog with the cool keyboard that all those tech bros are envious of). Some artists have a lot of free time and decide to create additional characters. These artists will then auction them off on social media (yes, really) and hand over the reference sheet (an image that describes how the character _should_ look like from several angles and the color palette at play) once the winner pays.

From then on, the "owner" of the character is widely inferred to be the winner of the auction. This isn't actually verified anywhere in most cases, but using someone else's character without permission is a very harsh taboo to break. If people really want to verify, they have to track down the original artist and ask them. This is a decentralized system, but it usually works out because most people are actually honest about the "ownership" of adoptable characters.

Sometimes artists have ideas for an entire species of characters with its own lore, art and norms. A lot of the time, these ideas will be posted publicly for anyone to share and use. This is how you get things like [Sergals](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Sergal), which are sort of cheese-headed bipedal furry things. In the Sergal lore, they are native to `$SOME_OTHER_PLANET` and the creators place no limits on who can create and use Sergal characters as long as they follow the few core differentiators (they are not mammals, etc).

Other times artists aren't so open with their ideas. They may want to have an exclusive club for the people that "own" characters of that species. So, they "close" the species and say that only people they approve of can make characters with those characteristics. Then they charge a "licensing fee" for entry into that club. Breaking the taboo and making your own closed species character without a "license" can result in a lot of artists denylisting you and then it will make getting art of any of your characters difficult.

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="facepalm">
  Yes, this is a thing that actually happens in real life. I was almost
  subjected to this because the original idea for this character was a "closed
  species".

Yes, really. The "Cadey" character you see on the blog was originally envisioned as an [orcadragon](https://www.deviantart.com/junkyardrabbit/journal/Orcadragon-Species-Information-516768513) and I was going to get a reference sheet as such but then I found out about the clusterfuck that is a "closed species". I thought about messing up the details and calling it a drakonorka (lit: dragon-orca in Lojban), but I ended up just cutting off the horns and wings and calling it a day. It made it easier to get commissions that way; a surprising number of artists buy into the "closed species" thing.

<XeblogSticker name="Cadey" mood="percussive-maintenance"></XeblogSticker>

I have since decided to pay into the "closed species" ecosystem and I have two "licenses" for orcadragons for both Cadey and another character I've been incubating for the blog named [Palima](https://xeiaso.net/blog/sleeping-the-technical-interview). Once I get the reference sheets, I plan to get the Cadey stickers redrawn as well as bring Palima into the blog properly as the God of Haskell.

### Tying it together with NFTs

So with all this in mind, what is an NFT really? If it's not the art associated with that token, what is it? Let's take a look at the word "fungible" a bit closer. When something is fungible, it means that the thing is interchangeable with others like it. A normal white pair of socks is basically identical to another normal white pair of socks. If you have a dollar bill, you can replace it with basically any other dollar bill and the value doesn't really change. A non-fungible item can't be replaced like this. Consider the difference between _any_ pair of white socks and the pair of white socks that you wore every day while you were biking to school during a PhD program. There's value to that pair of socks beyond the inherent value of those socks as a way to cover your body. Non-fungible tokens are not fungible either. There's metadata that lets you say that you have _a specific_ token by ID, not just any token in the collection. It's not a fungible thing in the same way that bread and oil are.

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  I am skipping over a _lot_ of economics speak here though. There are people
  much better suited to talking about this. I am not one of them.
</XeblogConv>

One great thing about humans is that we can _intend_ for things to mean one thing, but they will end up meaning _vastly different things_ to others. NFTs are a great example of this principle in action. Common understanding has owning an NFT to mean that you _own the art_ associated with it. Consider the example of the [people who bought that copy of Dune](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/an-nft-group-bought-a-copy-of-dune-for-304-million-thinking-its-the-copyright) (one of the best science-fiction/fantasy books ever written) and were planning to adapt the book into a movie adaptation with a "decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)" at the reigns.

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  I'm not going to get into DAOs in this article. I don't have enough experience
  in them to speak confidently about what I think about them. I'm not quite sure
  what purpose they serve though.
</XeblogConv>

There's not been any court cases to set legal precedent for what owning an NFT means. In the eyes of the blockchain people, they seem to think that owning the NFT means you own the copyright to the thing. This could mean that if you make a TV series planned around a character on an image associated with an NFT and then get the NFT social engineered away from you, you [may have to cancel plans for the show unless you pay off the hacker to get the token back](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/06/seth-greene-recovers-lost-nft-1234733180/).

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="flop">
  Or you'll have to admit that the blockchain isn't the authority on
  intellectual property and your performative pretending that it is an authority
  is a scam in order to get money from people.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  "Code is law" my ass.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="wave">
  Well, to some extent, an NFT can legally mean whatever you write a contract
  (traditional, not smart) for the NFT to mean. But that would require the court
  to decide on it, but I think there is an argument to be made that this would
  fall under the same umbrella as licensing terms, where you can sue someone for
  violating your licensing terms and require them to pay damages. That’s all
  speculation though, I haven’t heard of it being tested in court. “An argument
  to be made” doesn’t really mean much though; once upon a time someone made an
  argument that all internet moderation is illegal based on a legal precedent
  that a corporate town couldn’t prevent people from having fliers in a magazine
  display or something, and therefore we had to let them say anything they
  wanted anywhere they wanted or we’re violating the law. So we’ll see what
  happens in court when actual lawyers deal with it.
</XeblogConv>

Without any formal guidance on what all this means or any kind of legal precedent for how to handle all this, it's very unclear what owning an NFT actually does in the eyes of the law. If the NFT goes up in value by a significant amount of money, does that mean you owe capital gains tax? The government has really not caught up with the masses yet and a lot of cryptocurrency technology really exists in a gray area. The kind of gray area that gets dicey with the IRS. You do not want to get dicey with the IRS.

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  It seems that the US is treating cryptocurrency accounts like foreign
  accounts. I'm personally planning on filing my cryptocurrency accounts in my
  FBAR with my other Canadian accounts come tax season. It's probably overkill,
  but it's better to give the IRS more information than they need. Filing taxes
  is going to be _fun_ this year. The sacrifices I make for you people's
  amusement.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="loaf">
  I don’t own any cryptocurrency, so I don’t have to deal with the taxes!
</XeblogConv>

I think it is probably best to treat NFTs as something close to sticker or stamp collecting. The tokens themselves are probably inherently worthless (save of course the minimum cost needed to deploy the contract associated with them and the gas fees to mint the tokens), but together they likely have sentimental value to the owner as well as an "aesthetic value" depending on what the creator of that NFT collection was doing when they designed the art itself.

There's also NFTs called [Proof of Attendance Protocol](https://medium.com/new-to-nfts/what-is-a-poap-nft-2a524bb81123) or POAP. These are like ticket stubs at concerts. They let you have collectables associated with specific events, gatherings, or other such things. There's a POAP that's there for anyone who was at the party to celebrate Ethereum's merge to the proof of stake (read: not burning down the forests as much for magic internet money) chain. I personally haven't seen a super good use for these yet, but I can confirm that they are a thing that exists. I really wish I had a good example of how to use these, but I just don't.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="wave">
  Something something digital resume fodder to show that you went to

</XeblogConv>

To be honest though, _if implemented correctly_ NFTs could really help the furry community. Ownership of "adoptables" or the right to use a "closed species" character would be unambiguous. They could even have resale value that gives a commission back to the original creator (provided the relevant smart contracts have a clause to factor this into the equation); and there would be a neutral registry that _anyone_ can read from and confirm ownership of characters in cases where that is relevant to the participants.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="snug">
  I could argue that adoptables and closed species and OCs and such are
  *already* de facto NFTs, just without any automation or engineered resistance
  to bad actors. Most artists will request the permission from the “owner” of
  the OCs before they draw the character. Adoptables are sold like NFTs, with an
  artist creating them whenever they feel like and putting them up for sale in a
  gallery that users can purchase from and they then “own” that unique art and
  rights to the character, though the artwork itself is still freely available
  online for anyone who likes to view or download.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  Or just right-click on the art and put it into the hypercloud. Take that,
  liberals!
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="idle">
  So, in practice, furry artwork is *already* NFTs, just implemented as an
  ad-hoc, undocumented, unverifiable social contract with bad actors, punishing
  the non-punishers, no way to actually check claims of wrongdoing or see if
  they’ve been resolved, and multiple incompatible social norms that people
  can’t just accept federation and say which section they’re in because none of
  them are documented and that person is the enemy and must be brought into
  line. Oh, and also beholden to the capricious whims of puritans putting
  pressure on payment processors or Patreon or whatever to rugpull artists and
  keep their money. This is *NOT GOOD*.
</XeblogConv>

We can't use any of that in furry-land because the NFT bros pissed off furry artists by scraping twitter, deviantart, and e621 to flip into cheap NFT grifting so much that the entire technology space has become wrongthink to some people. By doing all of this research and writing this article I have probably made some people block me, _even though I'm ending up concluding that all of this space is a bad thing as currently implemented_. It is difficult to describe the level of contempt that a lot of furries have for this technology. I have seen communities with previously irreconcilable differences come together to try and destroy scammers flipping their art into NFTs. So yeah, this entire tech would be _revolutionary_ to the furry community, but nobody wants anything to do with it because idiots pissed in the pool and now it just smells like aging piss.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="wave">
  Though I am very glad that furry culture does resist corporatization so
  strongly, because it would be a horrible loss for the beauty, diversity, and
  expression of the community to be paved by megacorp lawyers into a
  metaphorical parking lot or suburban lawn. I’m also very glad that furry
  culture has such strong social norms for supporting artists and making sure
  that such critical members of the community that produce so much value
  actually get to make a living from it. There is less paywalling in furry art
  than many other kinds of art, while furry artists also get reliably paid more
  than many other kinds of independent artists, and that’s great! Maybe with
  some effort we could solve some social and technical problems to reduce
  paywalls while also increasing the benefit of the artists, and make the
  environment better for everyone. But that seems… difficult right now. Maybe
  someday. For now we can just keep upholding the furry values of inclusion,
  freedom, kindness, weird porn, and punching nazis.

  Oh yeah, by the way: they want to use NFTs in video games.

## They want to share items in games

So imagine a world where you can share items between games. Let's say that if you get a weapon in Splatoon you should be able to use it in other games. So you get a [Splatana Wiper](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Splatana_Wiper) from Sheldon and you really like how it plays in the Splatoon meta. Then you close Splatoon and open up Call of Duty. The NFT bro dream is that you'd be able to pull the Splatana out of Splatoon and then drop it into your Call of Duty loadout so that you can whack people in the face with it for 120 damage.

Imagine if this could spread to other items too. Unlocking an outfit or weapon class for Sena in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 means you can take that outfit to other games like Fortnite. Grab a bunch of items from Harmony in Splatsville and then use them all to decorate your house in Animal Crossing!

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  How would any of this actually...work? This sounds nice yeah but how would it
  make any sense? Maybe sharing items between Animal Crossing and Splatoon makes
  sense (they share a development team and game engine even). But Call of Duty
  and Splatoon are about as polar opposites as Quake and Chess. Wouldn't that
  look like a mess kinda like VRChat or Second Life?
</XeblogConv>

This won't work at all in practice. Every one of those games I listed has its own unique art style and that artstyle dictates a lot about the vision and direction of the games in question.

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Okay, Fortnite is a bit of an exception. It _used to_ have a cohesive artstyle
  at the beginning, but over time it's turned into a game where Rick from Rick
  and Morty, Goku, Naruto, and
  [Marshmello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmello) can get into a squad
  together and Hadouken people to death; it's more surreal than it sounds.
</XeblogConv>

This would also make game balance nearly impossible. Taking that example of moving a Splatana from Splatoon into Call of Duty more literally, the Splatana does 30 damage when the fire button is tapped and up to 120 damage when the fire button is held and you beat someone in the face with it. This is balanced because each squid/octopus child thing has 100 hitpoints, so 4 basic shots splats an opponent and if you get good at reading people you can oneshot people around corners. The base player health in Call of Duty is anywhere from [100 to 150](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Health_System). Depending on the game this could mean that the Splatana can either be about normally powered or hilariously underpowered to the point that you wouldn't want to use it anyways.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="snug">
  And then you bring it into Minecraft where players have 20 hit points and
  every attack is a one hit kill. But wait, do you lose it across all games when
  you die? Can you bring it with you every time you spawn?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  Does the ink coverage from the Splatana stay in the equation? Do you also get
  the Ultra Stamp special? How would games know to account for this?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="loaf">
  In Planetary Annihilation and Supreme Commander, the ink coverage from the
  Splatoon weapons would obviously be an auxiliary power generation mechanic,
  representing some kind of nanomachine based solar array. Which means that the
  meta for competitive play would require purchasing and progressing to high
  levels in games from completely different genres, and I can’t imagine the
  gaming community putting up with that. It would also require
  quadratic-or-worse balancing efforts where every game needs to care about the
  balance of every other game and write code to handle bringing items and
  mechanics in from every other game, and/or it would allow anyone who feels
  like self-publishing a game to home-brew a balance breaking super item in
  whatever game they want, and I can’t imagine that game developers would put up
  with that.
  <br />
  <br />
  Oh, you missed something. Tie in mobile games released alongside a main desktop
  game occasionally share items between the two.
</XeblogConv>

We do have one thing that is close to this ideal, but it's very limited as you'd imagine. VTuber software is segmented into two types, 2D and 3D. I can't speak much about the 2D software, but for 3D VTubers we use a model format called [VRM](https://vrm.dev/en/) as a vendor-neutral interchange format. I can pull my VRM avatar into other games such as [Synth Riders](https://synthridersvr.com/) and dance around on stream:

<center>
  <iframe
    width="560"
    height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tC0tgvHqHqw"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</center>

I can take that same model and plunk it into Godot and then animate it out to do whatever I want. The artstyle is maintained because all of these avatars have shading metadata that denotes them as anime styled. This is mainly because the VRM format was made by Japanese VTuber software developers and mostly because that's what the whole project was intended to be used for: anime styled VTuber characters.

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="facepalm">
  It's pretty nice in practice, but there's a depressing amount of software out
  there such as VRChat that won't let me import a pre-rigged model, which means
  that I have to do a [variety of annoying
  hacks](https://xeiaso.net/blog/vrchat-avatar-to-vrm-vtubing-2022-01-02) to get
  things working.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="wave">
  I have a few disagreements with the design of VRM, and a lot of annoyances at
  the lack of support for it. But that discussion is for another time.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="happy">
  At least the VRM format works and it's already supported by multiple engines.
  It will get adoption in time, it can also be extended if that is really
  needed. I really wish there were more games supporting it.

## What is Ethereum worth?

I've been talking about Ethereum for most of this article because Ethereum is the cryptocurrency that everyone seems to base all their work on. It was the first chain where smart contracts and NFTs really took off. However, I've never really covered what Ethereum is _really worth_. What is an Ethereum token? How does it have value?

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">

  <br />
  <br />

</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="facepalm">
  Okay, yes, from the philosophical standpoint modern currencies don't really
  have value backed by anything. Once the US abolished the [Gold
  standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) the value of the US
  dollar was detached from the value of physical hunks of gold and it became a
  [fiat currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money). So in essence a
  dollar bill in your pocket doesn't really have its own value outside of the
  mass psychosis that everyone experiences to think that the US dollar has
  value. At the same time though, the US government has this thing called "an
  army", which kind of enforces the idea that the US dollar has value.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="idle">
  The inherent value of one US dollar is that you could use it as toilet paper

  it](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics).
  Everything else comes from that little bit of text on it “This note is legal

So with all this in mind, what is Ethereum really worth? Honestly after doing a bit of research I can't really find a solid answer to this seemingly simple question. Money is complicated. Economics is a very nihilist field of study when you peel back all the layers of terminology and math.

Ethereum used to be a proof of work consensus blockchain, which is a bunch of buzzwords that means that some nodes on the network called "miners" would have GPUs solving sudokus 24/7 in order to get a hash that met certain criteria. When that happened, the miner would be awarded with a block's worth of tokens. Ethereum is also unlike other cryptocurrencies because Ethereum has no supply cap (the maximum number of tokens that can exist) unlike Bitcoin that has a cap of 21 million bitcoins ever being able to exist.

So if Ethereum is no longer a proof of work chain (IE: the price of an Ethereum token had value from the power wasted by the miner attempting to create it) and there's no cap of how many tokens can exist, what is Ethereum really worth?

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="snug">
  The difficulty of the creation doesn’t create value, it creates scarcity. The
  value needs to come from something else. This is where gas fees come in. It’s
  tempting to say that the value of Ethereum is the amount of computation that
  can be purchased on the Ethereum blockchain by burning the eth for gas. But
  that doesn’t explain the price; computing on the Ethereum blockchain is really
  inefficient because of all the validators double checking the computations, so
  the amount of money it would cost to buy the computation on a cloud compute
  provider and the amount it would cost to buy on Ethereum if nothing else were
  in play are very different, and the actual price of gas doesn’t match that
  either. So they have to be paying for *something*, and that something is
  legitimacy. We can view Ethereum as a machine for taking one big agreement,
  the agreement about the consensus algorithm, the smart contract instruction
  set and runtime, and what the current head of the chain is, and transforming
  that into a billion tiny agreements about who owns what and how to handle
  every little transaction. In this view, the value of gas, and by extension the
  value of Ethereum, is the value of making trustworthy agreements about digital
  objects. And it turns out that globally accessible and verifiable trustworthy
  agreements about digital objects are *extremely valuable*.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  This is something that we haven't really considered before. Before that
  argument I thought that Ethereum really just had the same worth that you get
  with government issued currency: everyone just agrees it has value and trading
  volume along with "market confidence" would dictate the value. Ethereum being
  worth the legitimacy of the system is a vastly different thing to think about.
  <br />
  <br />
  What about the Ethereum VM? Don't you use Ethereum as "gas" for the virtual machine
  that processes all the smart contract executions and transactions? How does that
  fit into it all?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="wave">
  Not quite. You buy gas with Ethereum. The Ethereum VM is the language by which
  you describe the rules of how something is legitimate. If you want to make
  something that has legitimacy, you need to explain exactly how legitimate
  interactions with it go. For example, a legitimate interaction with a store is
  you pay a specific price and in exchange receive a specific good; if you do
  not offer enough, your money isn’t taken and you don’t get the good; if you
  offer too much you get the good and any excess back. A legitimate interaction
  with a voting booth is that you mark down your choice on each part of the
  ballot, possibly including marking abstain fields, and submit it to the vote
  exactly once; the voting booth guarantees that the ballot you cast will be
  included in the results and that no fictitious ballots that no person
  submitted or multiple ballots from the same person are included. These rules
  have to be written down to be enforced, and the more complicated the rules are
  to check and more states they depend on the more difficult they are to
  enforce: thus, the Ethereum VM is how the rules of legitimacy are written down
  so everyone can agree on them, and gas usage is the measure of how difficult
  it is to perform the transaction according to the rules so everyone agrees on
  it. When you submit a transaction to the Ethereum network, you include in it a
  marker for how much you are willing to pay per unit of gas, and how much gas
  you are willing to buy before you would rather not have the transaction go
  through. Different miners might have different amounts that they’re willing to
  sell gas for, and so being willing to pay more for gas means that a miner that
  is willing to accept that rate will be selected sooner and the transaction
  will complete sooner, and if you don’t pay enough a miner will never accept
  it. So this makes it so that you can effectively pay a premium for expedited
  processing of your transactions or pay lower rates for slower inclusions.
  Ethereum is the only payment you can buy gas with, so apart from regarding
  Ethereum as a speculative asset, gas is really where the value gets meaning.
  It’s the atomic cost of ensuring legitimacy for a single step of operation.
  (Things can be legitimate without the legitimacy being checked; it’s possible
  that the weird person on the subway with a deed written on toilet paper in
  crayon offering to sell the Mona Lisa for $100 actually is the legitimate
  owner and will honor the deal, but in order for other people to actually trust
  the legitimacy it needs to be checked in some way that people can trust, which
  takes effort and coordination and thus has to cost *something*, even if it’s
  "a miniscule amount of credits from a UBI or publicly funded service" or "a
  nebulous tiny expenditure of social capital among the community" (if you’re
  wondering what something nebulous like that costs, just imagine that someone
  used and abused the thing so much that the providers had to stop them; what
  did they run out of that caused them to get dropped))

I think the main takeaway here is that Ethereum is _fundamentally worthless_ in the same way that US dollars are, but fiat mass psychosis and trading volume gives it value.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="wave">

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">

  This is going to end with financial nihilism even more isn't it.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="idle">
  I'm kinda already there? And from my perspective of financial nihilism,
  calling it mass psychosis is misleading; the value of a dollar is not a mass
  delusion, it is a reasonable, evidence based belief that you will be able to
  exchange the dollar for a given amount of stuff later. It's just that there is
  no centrally mandated exchange rate to some other currency. Because gold is
  just another currency; you can't eat gold, and only recently did it become
  useful in industrial processes that the average person cares about/is
  materially affected by (electronics manufacture, among others (which isn't
  something the average person can do on their own, so that doesn't affect the
  argument)), so gold is acting as just another currency: it's value is based on
  the reasonable, evidence based belief that you will be able to trade it for a
  given amount of the stuff you want in the future. And it isn't pegged to
  anything, so the value can fluctuate significantly as the market changes. So,
  way back when, a bank note/IOU/check from any local bank, an appraiser's note,
  a dollar, a physical lump of gold, etc. were all fiscally equivalent in some
  sense by being denominated in terms of the same thing. It would be like making
  a currency in the modern day where each note of it corresponds to a given
  number of USD. (Like say $100 USD notes, which are pegged to the price of $1
  USD notes, since you can exchange one for the other at any bank (though the
  pegging isn't perfect; there is some fluctuation in the value so that the
  values of 1 $100 USD note and of 100 $1 USD notes aren't exactly the same) or
  just a stablecoin.)

This all leaves me with a bit of a sour note. The idea that they are peddling is that cryptocurrency is a means of liberation against a "broken" financial system, but then the solution is just another means of limitation. Want to send a payment to a friend? That will cost ten cents to a dollar depending on the time of day. Want to get a new NFT? Ten cents to a dollar. Want to be in this club? Better get one of the tokens! They're all sold out? Too bad! Buy one second-hand! It's really just another method of dividing people into haves and have-nots. God knows we need more of them.

All of this really just adds more and more layers to this game of capitalism that we are all forced to play against our wills. Sure, the model of cryptocurrency allows you _relative freedom_ within its rules, but there are still fundamental limitations to what you can do with things outside its cryptosystem. One of the artists I like to commission lives in Russia, so paying them is difficult (especially after Paypal pulled out of there) except for when I use cryptocurrency.

Don't get me wrong, cryptocurrencies work great when the system is self-contained, but as soon as real money and assets get involved it becomes a huge mess. This relative freedom is another layer of capitalistic hierarchy and it helps the early adopters and the already rich get richer (through transaction fees and block rewards).

In practice though, the distributed ledger usually ends up having a few big players that sell blockchain API access as a service. The blockchain for Ethereum is over one terabyte. This is an _insane_ amount of disk space. There are efforts to lessen this, but at the time of writing the blockchain is just _too big_ for most people to use themselves. So you need blockchain access as a service. Which means you need to pay up to use your distributed money in the first place. This kind of defeats the point of having decentralized money if people are just going to recentralize around large players to be able to use it.

  One terrifying consequence of the way people interact with Ethereum is the
  existence of the generalized transaction frontrunning bot. We’ll have to get
  into what that actually means in a future part, but here there be monsters.

  The masses think they are free to send money to each other but the rich just
  get richer off their backs along the way. As above, so below.

  This whole thing is a mess. I only play this capitalism game because I have no
  other choice, not because I want to.

<XeblogConv name="Open_Skies" mood="flop">
  Yeah. I just want to make useful things and help people, and only being
  allowed to make useful things at scale if I also make them artificially less
  useful in order to ensure I capture the value created by them is annoying.

## Conclusion

I don't really have a good conclusion here. I don't know how I feel about Ethereum. It's got me split down the middle because there are _good ideas_ here. There are things that if done correctly are genuinely useful. There's just so many grifters. I didn't want to go into the grifters too much in this article, there is going to be more in future parts to this series.

While I was writing this article I was contacted by someone representing a "play to earn" game (one where you get NFTs that act as game objects for playing a game connected to the blockchain) offering me 0.55ETH (about USD$731 at the time of writing) to make three tweets shilling their game that had _22 online players_ and no public client download. $731 isn't even worth the tax burden (including my having to explain things to my accountant, who is probably going to go on a furious googling spree), not to mention the reputational damage that I would incur for shilling such a "product".

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Perfect timing, eh?
</XeblogConv>

All of this technology is really cool, I just wish I could use it for anything productive. I'm able to commission that one artist with it at least. Maybe there will end up being some kind of killer app with all of this, but until then I'm just gonna keep playing video games and writing these near novel-length articles. I'm also going to have to continue blocking and reporting the scams people shovel at me on Twitter.
