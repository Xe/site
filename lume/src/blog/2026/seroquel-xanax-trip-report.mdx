Nobody warns you about the dreams. Not properly. Seroquel has this well-documented side effect that doctors mention like a footnote — "you might experience vivid dreams." _Vivid._ That word does not begin to cover what happens when you combine quetiapine with Xanax and let your unconscious mind run unsupervised.

Last night's experience was coherent enough to document and strange enough to demand it. I'm writing this as a trip report because that's functionally what it was — an involuntary psychedelic experience courtesy of my post-operative medication stack. Most of the details are already blurring at the edges, but the core narrative and the closing message burned themselves in hard enough to survive the morning.

Here's what I remember.

---

The dream opened in a mall. One of those sprawling American retail cathedrals with fluorescent lights humming overhead and tile floors stretching to vanishing points. An Old Navy storefront glowed ahead of me like a beacon. But the world outside normal commercial reality had collapsed into a Purge scenario — total lawlessness, society fully unraveled. Old Navy staff had barricaded themselves inside the store and were defending it like it was the last outpost of civilization. A clothing store as a citadel.

I was naked. Completely, helplessly exposed in the middle of this chaos, and I _needed_ to get inside that store to find something to wear. Not vanity — survival. That particular dream-urgency that sits somewhere between panic and prayer, the most basic human drive to cover and protect your body. The staff wouldn't let me in.

Every step was agony. Movement felt like pushing through molasses and mud, that dream-physics where your legs betray your intent and thirty feet might as well be thirty miles. Old Navy was _right there_. I could not reach it.

At the center of everything stood a child. A small boy carrying himself with an authority that had nothing to do with his age. In the dream's logic he was the heir to Old Navy — the literal successor to whatever throne this retail empire represented. Around his head he bore a triangular scepter: part crown, part weapon, all authority. He kept reappearing at the forefront of my vision, always ahead of me, always between me and wherever I was trying to go.

The scepter was sealed shut. A closed triangle, every vertex locked to every other, no gaps, no openings. In the synaesthetic grammar of the dream I understood exactly what that meant: a belief system with no entry points and no exits. Self-contained. Self-referencing. Impenetrable. The heir didn't know his scepter was sealed because from inside the triangle, there was no outside.

  This maps to what epistemologists call a closed epistemic loop — a belief
  structure where all evidence gets interpreted through the existing framework,
  making disconfirmation structurally impossible. Conspiracy theories work this
  way. So do certain theological traditions. So do some software architectures,
  honestly.

Standing near the child was a figure I can only describe as a black mage. Tall, robed, face obscured — the archetype without the menace. He wasn't a threat. He was a narrator, a docent in a museum of the unconscious mind, and he spoke to me directly about what I was seeing with the unhurried patience of someone who'd been giving this particular lecture since before time had a name.

His subject was belief itself. He described how people construct what he called _principalities of the mind_ — self-sustaining kingdoms of thought that hold together through internal consistency alone. Every belief reinforces every other belief. Contradictions get absorbed or expelled before they can do structural damage. The entire edifice sustains itself indefinitely even when its foundation rests on absolutely nothing — because nobody inside the principality can see the foundation. The child heir, with his sealed triangular scepter, was the demonstration made flesh.

Movement never got easier. The child kept catching the fluorescent light with his sealed scepter. The mage kept explaining, calm and unhurried, like he'd been delivering this particular lecture since before I was born and would keep giving it long after I woke up.

And then the dream began to close. The mall, the barricaded Old Navy, the lawless chaos — all of it thinning like scenery being struck after a final act. But the mage remained.

He stepped toward me. Looked at me directly — not past me, not through me, _at me_. And with the calm finality of someone delivering a message they'd carried a very long way: "Your scepter is unbound — do with this what you will."

---

I woke up and lay there for a long time.

The contrast was the whole point. The child heir's scepter was sealed — a closed system, a belief structure that admitted no revision, no new information, no doubt. His triangle was perfect and complete and _stuck_. Mine was unbound. Open. Undetermined.

  I honestly don't know if this is my unconscious mind processing the surgery,
  the medication doing something weird to my REM cycles, or just the kind of
  thing that happens when you stare down your own mortality and then your brain
  has opinions about it. What I do know is that the symbolism was so
  on-the-nose it felt like getting a lecture from my own subconscious.

In chaos magick there's this idea that beliefs are tools. You pick them up, you use them, you put them down when they stop serving you. They're not identity. They're not destiny. They're "a person's preferred structure of reality," and the emphasis is on _preferred_. You chose this. You can choose differently.

Principalities of the mind are what happens when someone forgets that their belief system is a tool and starts treating it like a law of nature. The triangle seals shut. The scepter becomes a prison you can't see because you're inside it. And the really insidious part — the part the black mage was so patient about explaining — is that from inside a sealed principality, everything looks _fine_. The system works. The beliefs are consistent. Reality makes sense. You just can't move.

An unbound scepter is the opposite of certainty. It's uncomfortable. It means your worldview has gaps and entry points, places where new information can come in and restructure everything you thought you knew. You don't get the comfort of a sealed triangle. You get agency instead.

    Wait, so the _good_ outcome is having an incomplete belief system? That
    sounds terrifying.

    Terrifying and free are sometimes the same word. A sealed scepter protects
    you from doubt but also from growth. An unbound one lets everything in —
    which yeah, overwhelming — but it also means you can actually _move_.
    Unlike the heir, who stood frozen at the center of his own principality,
    needing nothing, going nowhere.

Maybe that's the real reason I couldn't move in the dream. Wading through molasses, barely able to put one foot in front of the other — but at least I _was_ moving. The heir stood perfectly still with his sealed scepter. He didn't struggle because he didn't need to. He was already everywhere he'd ever be.

Do with this what you will. That's what the mage said. Not a command. Not advice. Just permission. The acknowledgment that an unbound scepter is yours to shape, and the shaping is the whole point.

I think the message was the dream telling me what I'd already chosen. Or maybe it was saying that the choosing never stops — that staying unbound is itself a continuous act, not a state you arrive at and keep.

Your scepter is unbound. Do with this what you will.
