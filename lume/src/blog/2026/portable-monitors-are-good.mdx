My job has me travel a lot. When I'm in my office I normally have a seven monitor battlestation like this:

So as you can imagine, travel sucks for me because I just constantly run out of screen space. This can be worked around, I minimize things more, I just close them, but you know what is better? Just having another screen.

On a whim, I picked up [this 15.6" Innoview portable monitor](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0B2PJNG8D?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) off of Amazon. It's a 1080p screen that I hook up to my laptop or Steam Deck with USB-C. However, the exact brand and model doesn't matter. You can find them basically anywhere with the most AliExpress term ever: screen extender.

This monitor is at least half decent. It is not a colour-accurate slice of perfection. It claims to support HDR but actually doesn't. Its brightness out of the box could be better. I could go down the list and really nitpick until the cows come home but it really really doesn't matter. It's portable, 1080p, and good enough.

When I was at a coworking space recently, it proved to be one of the best purchases I've ever made. I had Slack off to the side and was able to just use my computer normally. It was so boring that I have difficulty trying to explain how much I liked it.

This is the dream when it comes to technology.

3/5, I would buy a second one.
