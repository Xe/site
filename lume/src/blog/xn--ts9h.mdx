Security is impossible. We just like to pretend otherwise so that we can
constantly project this aura of impenetrability that will save us from having to
admit the reality that it's impossible. One of the biggest targets in the modern
information security world is [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/). It is a command that
lets you *s*et *u*ser and then _do_ a command. Sudo is one of the most widely
deployed programs on the Internet and is widely regarded as critical
infrastructure.

<XeblogConv name="Aoi" mood="grin">
  Sooo the creators and maintainers of sudo take things very seriously by using
  something like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), maintain a high quality
  standard of malicious inputs by fuzzing all public attack surfaces, and try to
  minimize the amount of code involved in order to prevent vulnerabilities from
  being a problem?

  I don't know about the code quality standards of the sudo project, but overall
  I don't see them doing any concerted effort to try to migrate away from C (or
  to reduce the complexity of sudo) and there are
  [frequent](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22809)
  [security](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156)
  [vulnerabilities](https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/sudoedit_selinux)
  that result in attackers getting root access anyways. I really wish the
  industry as a whole would take languages like Rust a bit more seriously and
  start actually moving towards programs being safer to use because security
  vulnerabilities in core infrastructure result in emergency patches. It was
  disappointing to see [an attempt at using Rust in an important Python library
  torpedoed by users of obscure architectures not supporting
  Rust](https://lwn.net/Articles/845535/). Maybe the solution there is to use
  WebAssembly as a compile target instead of making everything be native code. I
  wouldn't wish hppa's reverse stack growth on anyone trying to write a compiler
  though.

I'm tired of this situation and I bet a lot of the ecosystem is too. There's
been talk and ideas, but not enough in the action department. I made a new tool.
A better tool. One that will let all of us proceed towards the future we
deserve. I made a sudo replacement named 🥺.

## <span class="text-3xl">🥺</span>

🥺 has no pronounceable name in English or any other speakable human language.
It is named 🥺, but it is referred to as `xn--ts9h` (the punycode form of 🥺) in
situations where emoji are not yet supported (such as Debian package names).

To use 🥺, install it (such as from the Debian package) and then run it in place
of sudo:

```
$ id
uid=1000(xe) gid=1000(xe) groups=1000(xe),102(docker)

$ 🥺 id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),102(docker),1000(xe)
```

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  Wait, what? That's it? How is this even secure at all? If it doesn't ask you
  for your password how can you be sure that an actual human is making the
  request and not some malicious script?
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  Using this program requires you to be able to type an emoji. Most attack code
  is of such poor quality that they are unable to run commands named with emoji.
  This makes the program secure.
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Aoi" mood="coffee">
  This is not how any of this works.
</XeblogConv>

Here it is broken down statement by statement.

First, I pull in a bunch of imports from the standard library and also the
[syslog](https://docs.rs/syslog/latest/syslog/) to write a message to syslog
about what's going on:

```rust
use std::{env, os::unix::process::CommandExt, process::Command};
use syslog::{unix, Facility::LOG_AUTH, Formatter3164};
```

Next, I create a main function that returns an
[`io::Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/type.Result.html), this is an
error that is returned by most of the standard library functions that do I/O
operations with the OS.

```rust
fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
```

The correct usage of this program is to run it like `🥺 id`, so if the user
doesn't specify a program to run, then it should blow up with an error message
instead of panicking:

```rust
if env::args().len() == 1 {
    eprintln!("usage: {} <command> [args]", env::args().nth(0).unwrap());
    return Ok(());
}
```

<XeblogConv name="Aoi" mood="wut">
  Wait, what? Why is it returning that everything is okay if the user is doing
  it wrong? Shouldn't it return some kind of error code that the running program
  or shell can catch?
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  It's a feature.
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Aoi" mood="coffee">
  I really hope I never have to maintain any of your code.
</XeblogConv>

Next, we grab the program name and arguments from the command line arguments of
🥺 and send a message to syslog that it's being run so that there is _some_
accountability after-the-fact:

```rust
let program = env::args().nth(1).unwrap();
let args = env::args().skip(2).collect::<Vec<String>>();
let mut writer = unix(Formatter3164 {
    facility: LOG_AUTH,
    hostname: None,
    process: "🥺".into(),
    pid: 0,
})
.unwrap();
writer
    .err(format!("running {:?} {:?}", program, args))
    .unwrap();
```

<XeblogConv name="Aoi" mood="wut">
  Wait so the emoji works there, but it probably isn't going to work in people's
  RSS feed readers? How does that make any sense?
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  It doesn't, lololol
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  UNIX is mostly devoid of the concept of character sets. Any character is fine
  as long as it doesn't have a null terminator (this ends the string in C). I'd
  be more amazed if the emoji use broke something, as there are legitimate uses
  for putting non-Latin characters into message buses like that. Also most RSS
  feed readers have very poor code quality.
</XeblogConv>

Finally, the actual command is executed:

```rust
Err(Command::new(program).args(args).uid(0).gid(0).exec().into())
```

This works because I'm using the
[`CommandExt`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/process/trait.CommandExt.html)
trait implementation of
[`Command`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html) that adds
some methods we need:

- [`uid(&mut self, id:
u32)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.uid)
  to set the user ID of the child process
  ([`setuid(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html) in C)
- [`gid(&mut self, id:
u32)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.gid)
  to set the group ID of the child process
  ([`setgid(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgid.2.html), though
  groups are starting to die out due to them not being across multiple machines
  without extra effort like configuration managment)
- [`exec(&mut
self)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/process/trait.CommandExt.html#tymethod.exec)
  which runs the
  [`execvp(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html) system call
  that _replaces_ the current 🥺 with the child process

The key part is the `exec` call at the end. One of the interesting things about
the `exec`-family of system calls in UNIX is that it _replaces_ the current
process if it succeeds. This means that the function will never return unless
some error happened, so the `exec` method _always_ returns an error. This will
make error handling happen properly and if things fail the process will exit
with a non-zero error code:

```
$ cargo run --release ls
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.06s
     Running `target/release/🥺 ls`
Error: Os { code: 1, kind: PermissionDenied, message: "Operation not permitted" }
```

<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  Sure, this error message could be better, but that's a 2.0 feature. This is a
  disruptive program poised to totally reshape the security industry so we have
  to _move fast and break things_!
</XeblogConv>

I'm fairly sure that this program has no bugs that aren't either a part of the
syslog crate or the Rust standard library.

## Installation

You can install 🥺 by downloading the `.deb` file from [my
fileserver](https://pneuma.shark-harmonic.ts.net/.within/xn--ts9h/) and
installing it with `dpkg -i`. This will give you the `🥺` command that you can
use in place of `sudo`.

<XeblogConv standalone name="Numa" mood="delet">
  This will let you stick it to the man and let you self-host your own sudo on a
  $5 a month VPS from a budget host. You can't have any vulnerabilities if there
  are no bugs to begin with!
</XeblogConv>

This is also known to work on Amazon Linux 2, so you can create blursed things
like this:

```
$ ssh -A xe@10.77.131.103
Warning: Permanently added '10.77.131.103' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

```

  Pro tip! You can apparently pass a URL to a `.rpm` file to `yum install` and
  it will just download and install that `.rpm` file. This is incredibly cursed.
</XeblogConv>

The `.deb` package was built on Ubuntu 18.04 and the `.rpm` package was built on
Amazon Linux 2, so it should be compatible with enough distributions that you
don't have to care.

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hacker">
  There's even a manpage you can read with `man 8 🥺`!
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Numa" mood="delet">
  And most importantly, [patches welcome](https://github.com/Xe/xn--ts9h)!

  By the way, there are many more lovely ways to get root than just by asking
  nicely with `setuid`. Why doesn't this program use those?
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  We gotta save _something_ for part 2, otherwise that would spoil all the
  _fun_.
</XeblogConv>

  I don't know if I like what you mean by "fun" there...
