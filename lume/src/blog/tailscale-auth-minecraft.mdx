  This page describes how to use Tailscale for authenticating to a Minecraft
  server without relying on Mojang’s authentication servers. It explains how to
  set up a proxy with infrared that replaces the Minecraft username with the
  Tailscale identity information. It also lists some advantages and
  disadvantages of this approach, such as increased security, privacy, and
  control over who can access the server, but also limited compatibility with
  the Bedrock version of Minecraft and potential username issues.
