My tax situation is complicated. Thanks to all of your efforts, it is now even
more complicated. I was running all of the number from last year, and in the
process I have discovered that this blog makes a profit. This is astounding.

Really, thanks for all of the support that you all have given me. It is a very
unique feeling, and it's comforting to know that should I hit rough times I
won't have to worry about keeping the lights on.

This article is going to contain some breakdowns of how much I've made and
spent keeping the lights on.

## Income vs profit

Here is the breakdown of income by each income stream for 2022:

(All amounts are US dollars)

| Source       | Amount   |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Ads          | $256.73  |
| Patreon      | $2451.19 |
| Itch         | $208.44  |
| Ethereum     | $996.24  |
| Twitch       | $207.27  |
| Other Income | $474.68  |
| Total        | $4564.55 |

This is more money than I could have ever imagined a single person's blog could
get. This is _an entire paycheck's_ worth of income and it's more than enough
to have the blog not only pay for itself, but I make _a profit_. Here's a
breakdown of the expenses that I incur for not only this blog, but all of my
personal infrastructure:

(All amounts are US dollars)

| Vendor        | Amount   |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Google        | $117.67  |
| Hetzner       | $587.67  |
| Digital Ocean | $386.28  |
| Vultr         | $231.44  |
| fly.io        | $16.85   |
| Cloudflare    | $174.54  |
| Porkbun       | $31.99   |
| Anbernic      | $407.99  |
| Backblaze     | $1.80    |
| AWS           | $43.90   |
| Total         | $2000.13 |

<XeblogPicture path="blog/2022-income/spend_per_vendor"></XeblogPicture>

This means that my total profit is just over 2.5 grand. This is _astounding_.
My blog is officially my most profitable side project ever.

I have cut out Cloudflare and I don't expect to spend more on Anbernic this
year. I'm also considering downsizing the server that my main blog runs on and
moving all the other stuff it does to fly.io and
[Funnel](https://tailscale.com/blog/introducing-tailscale-funnel/) to cut out a
huge amount of monthly spend. There is a lot of room for cutting things out in
other places, I'm pretty sure I could cut out almost all of my Digital Ocean
spend, and most of my Vultr spend could easily also head to fly.io and Funnel.

  I really wish I wasn't locked out of my Digital Ocean account though. Support
  has been unhelpful and I don't know what legacy infrastructure I have in that
  account so I can either upgrade it, cut it off, or move it elsewhere. Please
  help.

## Video game spend

When I ran these numbers, I also wanted to figure out if a joke I was telling on
stream was true: all of the excess Patreon money goes towards my crippling video
game addiction. I imported all of my invoices from the Nintendo eShop and Steam
into my spreadsheet (minus my Steam Deck) and I ended up with this figure:

(All amounts are US dollars, the Steam values were converted by machine at the
time of calculation, facts and circumstances can and will differ)

| Vendor   | Amount   |
| -------- | -------- |
| Nintendo | $288.79  |
| Steam    | $1236.13 |
| Total    | $1524.92 |

This means that I spend about 76% of my blog's profit on video games. It's
pretty great to have my blog pay for my entire gaming habit!

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  Do those numbers make sense? Is something not being converted to USD from CAD?
  The Steam number seems a bit high...
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  I'm pretty sure the numbers were correctly converted from CAD to USD, if this
  is wrong, then I only spent about $927.40 on Steam last year (a lot of the
  increased price is because games are more expensive in Canada due to HST and
  GST being higher than sales tax typically is in the US, combined with currency
  conversion fees baked into the price). This would make the total just over
  half of the net profit.

Thanks for all of the reading and sharing you do, it really helps a lot. I've
been working on new and interesting things (such as a longer article that
explains why I think [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) is cool with interactive
examples) and I hope you'll enjoy them. Let's see what 2023 will bring!

<XeblogConv standalone name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  If I ever incorporate for simplifying the tax situation of all of my side
  income, I am going to have to invoice myself to pay for video games that I
  reference on the blog or on stream. This is a very surreal thing to think
  about.
