  This page shows how to use nginx-auth, a tool that implements the NGINX HTTP
  subrequest authentication protocol, to authenticate requests to internal
  services proxied behind NGINX with Tailscale. It also explains how to install
  and configure nginx-auth and NGINX, and how to use the response headers to
  pass authentication information to the applications. The benefits of this
  approach are similar to setting up a corporate SSO system without the
  installation and maintenance overhead.
