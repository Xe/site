I've been writing a fair bit of JSX/TSX code lately and something has felt oddly
familiar about that programming model. It was something that I couldn't really
place until I had a breakthrough after hacking at my Emacs config again. When
you are using JSX to write HTML in your JavaScript functions, you are using
quasi-quoting.

<XeblogConv standalone name="Aoi" mood="wut">
  Quasi-quoting? What's that?
</XeblogConv>

I think one of the easiest ways to explain this is to use Emacs Lisp. Emacs Lisp
is the extension language for [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
the text editor that I ~~am horribly addicted to using~~ have used for the last
ten years.

One of the major concepts in Lisp is that code is data, and data is code. When
you are writing in Lisp, you are writing linked lists that the computer
interprets as code. For example, consider this small bit of Lisp:

```lisp
(quote (+ 3 4))
```

You can evaluate this with `ielm` in Emacs by using `M-x ielm`:

<XeblogConv standalone name="Mara" mood="hacker">
  `M-x` is Emacs-speak for "alt-x".
</XeblogConv>

```
*** Welcome to IELM ***  Type (describe-mode) for help.
ELISP> (quote (+ 3 4))
(+ 3 4)
```

Quoting code into data is something you do very often in Lisp, so there's a
shortcut for doing this using the single quote character `'`:

```
ELISP> '(+ 3 4)
(+ 3 4)
```

This works great, but sometimes you need to put the value of a variable into a
bit of data. Let's say you have this snippet of Lisp code:

```lisp
(let ((filename "foobar.txt"))
     '(filename))
```

<XeblogConv standalone name="Mara" mood="hacker">
  `(let ((var1 value) (var2 value)) code)` is how you declare temporary
  variables in Lisp. Here the variable name `filename` is set to `"foobar.txt"`.
  Each variable declaration is a list of two elements: the variable name and its
  value. Values can be data or code that is evaluated down to data.
</XeblogConv>

If you put this into the Emacs Lisp interpreter, you won't get back what you
think:

```lisp
ELISP> (let ((filename "foobar.txt"))
            '(filename))
(filename)
```

You need to have some way to quote code you want to be data, and then some way
to unquote data back into code. Luckily, Emacs Lisp lets you do this with a
construct they call
[Backquoting](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Backquote.html):

```lisp
ELISP> (let ((filename "foobar.txt"))
            `(,filename))
("foobar.txt")
```

The backtick <code>`</code> lets you quote everything like the single quote

<code>'</code>, but you can also _unquote_ data using the comma <code>,</code>
to turn your data back into code. This lets you construct complicated data
structures like an attribute list to convert into HTTP form data:

```lisp
ELISP> (let ((fname (buffer-name))
             (content "Hi there"))
            `((fname . ,fname)
              (content . ,content)))
((fname . "*ielm*")
 (content . "Hi there"))
```

<XeblogConv name="Aoi" mood="cheer">
  So quasi-quoting lets you mix data and code, but how does this relate to JSX?
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="aha">
  JSX is the same thing with slightly different syntax.
</XeblogConv>

[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is a syntax extension for
JavaScript that lets you mix HTML data with JavaScript code. It's a lot like
quasi-quoting in Lisp. Consider this small block of JSX code:

```typescript
const name = "Aoi";
const header = (
  <div>
    <h2>{name}</h2>
    <p>Hi there, {name}! How are you doing today?</p>
  </div>
);
document.write(header);
```

This writes the equivalent of this HTML to the current page:

```html
<div>
  <h2>Aoi</h2>
  <p>Hi there, Aoi! How are you doing today?</p>
</div>
```

You quote HTML data inside parentheses `()` and use curly braces `{}` to unquote
JavaScript code into HTML data.

<XeblogConv name="Aoi" mood="grin">
  So JSX does the same thing for HTML in JavaScript that quasi-quoting does for
  lists in Lisp! It lets you mix code and data so that you can assemble whatever
  you want easily.
</XeblogConv>
<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="happy">
  Yep! You end up finding a lot of these things across different programming
  tools. A lot of tools steal ideas from eachother and there are many more
  similar patterns across the industry. What other ones can you find?
