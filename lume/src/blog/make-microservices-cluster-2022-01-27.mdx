  So everyone is talking about microservices these days. I've been wondering
  what the best way to make a fully end-to-end continuously deployed multi-cloud
  federated global microservices cluster is. Do you have any advice? My product
  team needs this done quickly so we can meet an artificial deadline set by
  someone that doesn't understand the problems we face at all.

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Don't.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="happy">
  But based on all the artificial requirements this looks like it's the solution
  to all our needs! We can set up Anthos on GKE to combine our EKS clusters with
  our legacy onprem Kubernetes cluster so that we can have a fully hyperscaled
  coherent user experience across multiple continents!

  Do you like hurting yourself? You are not Google. You do not need to be
  hyperscale. You can probably get away with running this as one big monolith on
  a server you rent from a datacenter. Two servers if you want redundancy, but
  that's most likely not relevant until you get above several tens of thousands
  of daily active users. Single servers can do more than you think. Most of what
  you pay for in a server is idle compute. Use it.

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  But we need to have the ability to horizontally scale to meet the latency
  requirements that marketing made up so that our time to first byte is
  minimized, we need to reap that sweet, sweet SEO optimization so that people
  can connect and live with eachother while having the highest possible quality
  experience so they come back soon.

  If keeping customers is really your goal, make your product more addictive
  than porn, drugs and TikTok. Either that or make a cult. Those are great ways
  to abuse parts of the human baser instincts to make sure that you can maintain
  users over longer amounts of time.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hmm">
  But how do I make the cluster though?
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Don't.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="wat">
  But the SRE team I'm on can take care of the requisite setup.
</XeblogConv>

<XeblogConv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
  Lol, no it can't. You will be managing more servers than man has any right to
  care about. You will be subjecting yourself to a torture that the Geneva
  Convention has not banned yet because the sheer philosophical depths of
  depravity have not been fully understood yet. You will become an expert in
  YAML and then find out the truth of how much it will take out of your mortal
  lifespan. You will be fighting people trying to use HTML templating languages
  to create YAML and you will be terrified to find out that this strategy works
  at all. You will burn out so hard that you will never want to touch a computer
  again. 

  
  Do you really want to do this to yourself? Do you really want to subject
  yourself to a level of misery that will define the rest of your life? Do you
  want to have to explain what the torture nexus of AWS is to therapists? Do you
  want to create this reality? Doing this will do all of those things and more.
