  This page explains how to use a GitHub Action to automatically update
  Tailscale ACLs from a Git repository, following the GitOps pattern. It also
  shows how to prevent accidental changes to ACLs in the Tailscale admin console
  by adding a comment to the policy file. The benefits of this approach are
  better control, review, and testing of ACL changes.
