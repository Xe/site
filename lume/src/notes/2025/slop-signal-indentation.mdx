title: "New AI slop signal: code blocks with weird indentation"
desc: "If the first line of a set of commands isn't indented but the rest are: the post is AI slop"

I just discovered a new way to tell if a blogpost is AI slop or at least if someone blindly copied and pasted commands from Claude Code: the first line of a group of commands isn't indented but the rest are, like this:

```bash
sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  sudo apt autoremove
  sudo apt autoclean
```

This happens because the raw CLI output of Claude code for this question looks like this:

```text
> What are the commands to fully update an Ubuntu system? Just list the commands.

● sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  sudo apt autoremove
  sudo apt autoclean
```

And then the writer copied from the beginning of the set of commands to the end. Their text editor / formatting tool did not remove the preceding spaces because that's sometimes syntactically relevant in code blocks.

I'll keep y'all updated as I find more indicators. There are so many in the wild and it's making me grow weary.
