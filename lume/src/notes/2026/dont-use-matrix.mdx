Hey all, in light of Discord [deciding that assuming everyone is a teenager until proven otherwise](https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out), I've seen many people advocate for the use of [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) instead.

I don't have the time or energy to write a full rebuttal right now, but Matrix ain't it chief. If you have an existing highly technical community that can deal with the weird mental model leaps it's fine-ish, but the second you get anyone close to normal involved it's gonna go pear-shaped quickly.

Personally, I'm taking a wait and see approach for how the scanpocalypse rolls out. If things don't go horribly, we won't need to react really. If they do, that's a different story.

Also hi arathorn, I know you're going to be in the replies for this one. The recent transphobic spam wave you're telling people to not talk about is the reason I will never use Matrix unless I have no other option. If you really want to prove that Matrix is a viable community platform, please start out by making it possible to filter this shit out algorithmically.
