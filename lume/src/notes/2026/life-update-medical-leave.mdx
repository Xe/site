Hey all, I hope you're doing well.

I'm going to be on medical leave until early April. If you are [a sponsor](https://sponsors.xeiaso.net), then you can join the Discord for me to post occasional updates in real time. I'm gonna be in the hospital for at least a week as of the day of this post.

I have a bunch of things queued up both [at work](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog) and on this blog. Please do share them when you see them cross your feeds, I hope that they'll be as useful as my posts normally are. I'm under a fair bit of stress leading up to this medical leave and I'm hoping that my usual style shines through as much as I hope it is. Focusing on writing is hard when the Big Anxiety is hitting as hard as it is.

Don't worry about me. I want you to be happy for me. This is very good medical leave. I'm not going to go into specifics for privacy reasons, but know that this is something I've wanted to do for over a decade but haven't gotten the chance due to the timing never working out.

I'll see you on the other side. Stay safe out there.

Xe
