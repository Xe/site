    Hello, I'm Xe Iaso. I am a skilled force multiplier, acclaimed speaker, artist, and prolific blogger. My writing is widely viewed across 15 time zones and is one of the most viewed software blogs in the world.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
    I specialize in helping people realize their latent abilities and help to unblock them when they get stuck. This creates unique value streams and lets me bring others up to my level to help create more senior engineers. I am looking for roles that allow me to build upon existing company cultures and transmute them into new and innovative ways of talking about a product I believe in. I am prioritizing remote work at companies that align with my values of transparency, honesty, equity, and equality.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
    If you want someone that is dedicated to their craft, a fearless innovator and a genuine force multiplier, please look no further. I'm more than willing to hear you out.

<h3 class="text-xl mb-4">Fly.io - Senior Technophilosopher</h3>
<span class="text-md mb-4">2023-11 - 2024-09, Ottawa, CAN</span>

<p class="mb-4">At Fly.io I am responsible for helping to build the developer relations team from scratch. I am working with the team to create a new developer relations strategy that is focused on helping developers understand the value of Fly.io and how to use it in their projects. This includes in-person, online, and video content as well as occasional writing for the Fly.io and partner companies' blogs.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I also lead social media posting on websites like X (formerly Twitter) and have contributed heavily to social media strategy and content creation. I am the main maintainer of the Fly.io YouTube and TikTok channels.</p>

<p class="mb-4">While working here, I became an early expert in AI tooling and how to properly use locally hosted AI models. I am capable of using AI in new products as well as adapting it to existing products.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl mb-4">Tailscale - Archmage of Infrastructure</h3>
<span class="text-md mb-4">2020-12 - 2023-10, Ottawa, CAN</span>

<p class="mb-4">At Tailscale I founded the developer relations team with the goal of inspiring people to use Tailscale in fun and interesting ways. I work with the DevRel team to write articles for <a href="https://tailscale.dev">tailscale.dev</a> to help teach people fundamentals of computer science and networking in the process of learning about new product features and things you can do with them.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Tailscale has easily been the best job I've ever had and I've had an enormous impact on how Tailscale is percieved by developers worldwide. For a while my actions were directly attributable to MAU growth. One of the hardest projects I've worked on was making DevRel efforts more than single flashes in the pan and create a reason for people to visit the website on a regular basis.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I regularly write articles and lead internal talks about how to use Tailscale and other technology topics in new and interesting ways.</p>

<span class="text-md mb-4">2019-05 - 2020-11, Montréal, CAN</span>

<p class="mb-4">I spearheaded and maintained the internal Kubernetes deployment (with the goal of being functionally an in-house Platform-as-a-service) and all of the assorted tooling around it, helping internal developers deploy new features to customers faster. I also helped to create custom icons and color schemes for internal tools, with the goal of having consistent brand design for knowing which tool is which at a glance.
