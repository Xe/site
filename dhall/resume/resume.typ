#sigilAside[Hello, I'm Xe Iaso. I am a skilled force multiplier, acclaimed speaker, artist, and prolific blogger. My writing is widely viewed across 15 time zones and is one of the most viewed software blogs in the world.]

I specialize in helping people realize their latent abilities and help to unblock them when they get stuck. This creates unique value streams and lets me bring others up to my level to help create more senior engineers. I am looking for roles that allow me to build upon existing company cultures and transmute them into new and innovative ways of talking about a product I believe in. I am prioritizing remote work at companies that align with my values of transparency, honesty, equity, and equality.

If you want someone that is dedicated to their craft, a fearless innovator and a genuine force multiplier, please look no further. I'm more than willing to hear you out.    

== Experience

#titleCompany[Archmage of Infrastructure][Tailscale]\
#term[2020-12 -- _current_][Ottawa, CA]

At Tailscale I founded the developer relations team with the goal of inspiring people to use Tailscale in fun and interesting ways. I work with the DevRel team to write articles for #text(fill: blue)[#link("https://tailscale.dev")[tailscale.dev]] to help teach people fundamentals of computer science and networking in the process of learning about new product features and things you can do with them.

Tailscale has easily been the best job I've ever had and I've had an enormous impact on how Tailscale is percieved by developers worldwide. For a while my actions were directly attributable to MAU growth. One of the hardest projects I've worked on was making DevRel efforts more than single flashes in the pan and create a reason for people to visit the website on a regular basis.

While I worked at Tailscale, I attempted to spearhead the use of Nix and NixOS to declaratively manage our servers. This would have given us full knowledge of what packages and services were running on which servers, allowing us to know at a glance what server was doing what. Unfortunately, this project ultimately failed in ways that taught me a lot about the importance of clean, accessible documentation that is written for people that don't already understand the topic at hand. Even when a technically superior solution may exist, it is better to meet people where they are at and move forward together as a team.

I regularly write articles and lead internal talks about how to use Tailscale and other technology topics in new and interesting ways.

#term[2019-05 -- 2020-11][Montréal, CA]

My team and I created and maintained the internal Kubernetes deployment (with the goal of being functionally an in-house Platform-as-a-service) and all of the assorted tooling around it, helping internal developers deploy new features to customers faster. I also helped to create custom icons and color schemes for internal tools, with the goal of having consistent brand design for knowing which tool is which at a glance.

//This Kubernetes project ended up being too complicated for developers in practice. Even with a lot of tooling and deployment-on-rails templates to help bridge gaps between the inherent complexity of Kubernetes, Vault, Docker, and the intents of what they wanted to do, things ended up being very complicated once developers wanted to go beyond the die-cast templates we gave them.

The misadventures through Kubernetes' hidden complexity (especially when faced with developers that rightfully don't care about the details as long as things work) has taught me that "simple" is relative. There must be complexity somewhere and making things "simple" at one end merely moves the complexity around to another end. Templates to get you out the door are great things, but you can't stop at "hello world" and then throw people to the sharks.

I also learned a lot about how to teach via teaching my teammates how to write Go the way I learned how to write Go. I have learned that it is impossible to teach people without learning how to teach them, and it is impossible to learn things without teaching your teacher new insights.

While working on internal tooling, we did user research on how to approach designing command-line tools from a linguistic approach. We found that commands should be verbs, arguments should be nouns, and flags should be adverb clauses. This seems to help the most people understand tools in the most detail.

#titleCompany[Senior Software Engineer][Heroku]\
#term[2017-02 -- 2019-03][Bellevue, USA]

I maintained the subsystem for processing terabytes of customer metrics per week in real time, and tools that consumed this data, such as threshold alerting and autoscaling. We were hitting theoretical limits for Kafka performance by the time I left.

- Wrote and maintained integrations for JVM application metrics and Go runtime metrics
- Developed a FaaS platform prototype with my team
- Helped my team navigate complicated corporate politics and market conditions beyond our control

== Projects

==== Xesite\
The custom blog engine that powers #text(fill: blue)[#link("https://xeiaso.net")[xeiaso.net]]. It is a handcrafted work of art written in Rust with two goals:

1. To be as fast as possible to survive traffic surges from news aggregators without flinching.
2. To be easily extensible and hackable to meet my needs.

This project has been an overwhelming success and is the backbone of a lot of my personal development. Most of the things that would otherwise be written as separate projects have become extensions and modifications to my blog engine, allowing them to get a lot of traffic and hands-on user experience as soon as possible.

==== XeDN\
The software that powers #text(font: "Iosevka Curly Iaso Extended")[#link("https://cdn.xeiaso.net")[cdn.xeiaso.net]], currently serving over 4 terabytes of traffic per month without breaking a sweat. This powers the images, video, slides, and other files that I use to enrich my posts.

==== Xeact\
My custom frontend JavaScript framework. I regularly write about things I have learned working on it #text(fill: blue)[#link("https://xeiaso.net/blog/series/xeact")[on my blog]].

Working on this project has been the catalyst for me finally understanding how to do front-end development in web browsers. Xeact also powers internal tooling at Tailscale, being used daily by the support team to understand and diagnose customer issues.

==== #link("https://github.com/Xe/waifud")[waifud]\
My custom virtual machine manager for my homelab. waifud replicates most of the advantages of using cloud computing in my basement. I write about it regularly #text(fill: blue)[#link("https://xeiaso.net/blog/series/waifud")[on my blog]].
