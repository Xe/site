        Top tier satire. Won't be read by anyone who should read it, and will be ignored/laughed at by anyone who does/already agrees. <br />

        Literally preaching to the literal choir.

        Itâ€™s things like this that make me realize just how bizarre this profession really is.

        Why would you do that? Just use jRilkef and call $.flopnax() and it'll automatically flopnax your ropjar. (Marked +240345 by flopnax overflow)

        The comments I am reading in response to the words on the website miss the point completely. It is clear from the words on the web page on the link that the point is different than what people here are saying it is. Did you even read those words on the internet web page, accessed from the link, downloaded and subsequently rendered by your browser of choice?
