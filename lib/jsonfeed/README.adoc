This is a http://jsonfeed.org[JSON Feed] parser in Rust. Just a thin layer on top of `serde`, but it
provides serialization & deserialization, along with a Builder API for constructing feeds.

Note that this is alpha, I still need to add a lot of tests and a couple more features.

== Example

----
extern crate jsonfeed;
extern crate reqwest;

fn main() {
	let resp = reqwest::get("https://example.com/feed.json").unwrap();
	let feed = jsonfeed::from_reader(resp).unwrap();
	println!("Feed title is: {}", feed.title);
}
----

TODO:

* Tests. Lots and lots of tests
* Implement ability to add, serialize, and deserialize custom attributes from the json feed spec
