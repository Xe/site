title: "I'm speaking at Conf42 Rust 2022 and GambiConf EU's Online Day about how this site works!"
date: 2022-08-18

Over the last two weeks I've been working on a conference talk that just so
happened to be accepted to two conferences at once. It's about how this website
(the one you are reading right now) works and I am so excited to release this
out into the wild.

Want to know more? Here's a teaser:

at-mention me on Twitter with a screenshot of the game that the background in
that video comes from at the exact same spot!</xeblog-conv>

Here are the promo images I've been given:

The [Conf42](https://www.conf42.com/rustlang2022) version of this talk will be
live on M09 01 2022 at around 18:00 UTC.

> Blog engines are a fantastic opportunity for self-expression and
> overengineering things. This is the story of my blog engine through the years
> as I have made it faster and faster. I currently serve pages so fast that
> timing how long it took ended up taking longer than serving the pages in the
> first place. In this talk, I will go over how and why my blog engine in Rust
> is so fast and what you can learn from it to make your web applications even
> faster.

The [GambiConf](https://gambiconf.dev/) version of this talk will be live on M09
10 2022 at around 14:05 UTC.

> Dynamic webapps don't have to be slow. In this talk I will break out how I
> overengineered my blog with Rust to the point that people think it's a static
> site.

As an extra teaser, here's the first paragraph of my talk:

> Speed. Safety. Development experience. Fearless concurrency. These are all
> things that you associate with programs written in Rust. How about some more
> buzzwords? Words like elegant? That's a good one. I'm Xe Iaso and I'm going to
> share the gory details on how my blog works, and why people often mistake it
> for a static website. Buckle up and kick back, we're going to learn about the
> internet today.

Want to hear more? Tune to one of those two conferences! Both of them have a
fascinating set of talks that I am going to enjoy watching. 

As always, I'll get a page up on my website with the slides, talk transcript,
youtube embed and more! I'm looking at having this page up by M09 12 2022.
If you subscribe to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cadey) you'll get
access to my raw scripts (including draft scripts) and initial notes so you can
see the evolutions that took place in my creative process.
