With addiction, as with many other things, there's a tendency for the mind to label the situation and create a big story. A common phrase I see is "I want to get better", as if you're sick. You're not sick. You may identify yourself as an "addict", or you might feel fear because you are afraid you'll fail, or that you'll experience cravings, etc. but reminding yourself that you need to get better is perpetuating the narrative of sickness.

These are all stories, they have no bearing on reality. You can just embrace the cravings. Embrace the withdrawal. They are feelings, and they can be not acted upon, through mindfulness of them. Be mindful of your thoughts, but don't pay heed to them. Don't get caught up. And if you feel like your are getting caught up, realize that that's another feeling as well.

Such things don't last forever. Existence is change, inherently, inevitably. Embracing life is embracing change. Things in this world will change without warning. Things we consider safe and stable today will vanish tomorrow. Accept this as a fact of life.

To love is to gain and to lose in equal measure. To lose is to love in turn. Every journey upwards has its regressions downwards. 

It may sound like a subtle distinction between getting better from addiction, or from sickness, and just changing, but it’s really all the difference. A plant is not sick just because it later grows into a bigger tree. Change is just simply what happens, and it can be recognized and embraced in order to fully, progressively align the self with whatever intent or goal.

Fully embracing all that you are is the best way to bring this about, for you can be present to what happens and help it change through your intent, veer it towards the desired destination.
