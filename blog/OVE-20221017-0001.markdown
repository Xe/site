[PolyMC](https://polymc.org/) is a modpack manager for
[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) that allows users to manage
multiple logical installations of minecraft with their own sets of mods or
plugins. Today it seems that the main maintainer of PolyMC has deleted all of
the contributors from having access to the GitHub ACLs and has removed the code
of conduct as of
[PolyMC/PolyMC@ccf282593dcdbe189c99b81b8bc90cb203aed3ee](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/commit/ccf282593dcdbe189c99b81b8bc90cb203aed3ee).
The main maintainer has also been reportedly using charged language and slurs
freely as a result of being called out for this.

It is unknown at this time if PolyMC is compromised, but software like this
being in the hands of reactionaries is a very sketchy situation. I am monitoring
this situation and will give updates when I can.

It is unknown if it is safe to run existing installations of PolyMC, as [it
reportedly fetches metadata about .jar files to run at runtime](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/196460)
from a now presumably untrustworthy service.

If you are a user of PolyMC, it may be best to uninstall it until we can get
more information about this emerging situation. I am treating this as a
compromise of the upstream because that is the least bad way to describe this.
If you are a package maintainer for a distribution that packages PolyMC, use
`OVE-20221017-0001` as the vulnerability ID for your bug tracker. It may be best
to yank or freeze PolyMC until we get more information.
