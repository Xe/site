# WebAssembly Talk Video Posted

This May, I spoke at [GoCon Canada][goconcanada] about [WebAssembly on the Server][talklink]
and some of the inherent challenges and problems with trying to do it as things
exist currently. It's taken a while, but the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4l8RX0tA3E)
of that talk has been posted.

I hope you enjoy! I have some more blogposts in the queue but I've been sleeping horribly lately. Here's hoping that clears up.
