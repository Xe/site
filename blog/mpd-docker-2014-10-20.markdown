Today I got mpd set up inside docker to replace running it locally.


Being the perfectionist I am, I also got a simple web UI for mpd
([ympd](https://ympd.org/)) set up.

You can find the source repos here:

-   [<https://github.com/Xe/docker-ympd>\
    The ympd web frontend]
-   [<https://github.com/Xe/docker-mpd-kabaka>\
    A good friend's patchset to mpd in the form of a docker
    container]
-   [<https://github.com/Xe/docker-ncmpcpp>\
    ncmpcpp for controlling mpd from the command line]

Readmes will be in each repository shortly.
