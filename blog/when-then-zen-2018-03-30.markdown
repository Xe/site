# When Then Zen

Meditation is something that is very easy to experience but very difficult to
explain in any way that is understandable. Historically, things that man could
not explain on his own get attributed to gods. As such, religious texts that
describe meditation can be very difficult to understand without context in the
religion in question. 

I would like to change this and make meditation more accessible.

## A better way to teach meditation

At a high level, meditation is the act of practicing the separation of action
and reaction. There's a bunch of ways to do it, and in the course of this 
project I plan to cover a wide array of them.

The way I am teaching meditation is simple: teach the method and have people do
it and see what happens. I've decided to teach methods using [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin).
