In this report, we describe a discovered remote code execution
vulnerability in neural language processing systems. These systems,
currently in active use by major social media networks including but
not limited to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, allow for the crafting
of a carefully selected message that allows successful attackers to
gain control over the target victim.

We have demonstrated evidence of this proposed attack to be currently
in active use, and be unpatched in current implementations.
Additionally, we have found evidence this attack has been employed
successfully in the past, affecting a copper ore processing facility's
communication sytems.

This technique is known to be wormable, with common cases causing
spread across networks and social groups. This geometric spread can
lead to arbitrary philsophical execution on target systems, which will
result in denial of service in all cases.

The vulnerability arises from the intentional distortion of messages,
deviating from the expected interaction protocol. It can be
classified, partially, as a social engineering attack, whereby an
individual purposefully distorts ground truths, fabricating false
protocol axioms, to manipulate the perceptions of targets.

As the vulnerability lies within human interaction protocols,
rather than vulnerable systems, it can be classified as a supply chain
issue. As patching the vulnerable dependency is, as of right now,
infeasible, and potentially undesirable, software developers, social
media platforms, and communication service providers can implement
user interfaces and algorithms that alleviate the unpatched
vulnerability, until a proper fix can be implemented.

Nnaki Systems (the vendor of the vulnerable components of the human
instrument) has not yet released a patch to the to rectify this
vulnerability, with their CEO Anu claiming that this is "an
intentional feature" and releasing the following statement to
shareholders:

> Dear valued customers and stakeholders,
> 
> I would like to address recent claims regarding the alleged
> vulnerability, HVE-BC1750-0001, associated with our product. After a

Users are advised to take reasonable action to protect their systems
from these specially crafted messages and prevent spreading expoit
messages to others. It may be advisable to delete social media
applications such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Threads to avoid being
exploited.

This report would be impossible without the efforts of [Layl
Bongers](https://twitter.com/celphase). Many thanks to her alerting us
at Sovereign Integral Solutions so that we can issue this bulliten to
allow users to be protected against this glaring flaw.
