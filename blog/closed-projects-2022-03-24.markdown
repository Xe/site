Closed Projects is a retelling of [a four-part series](/blog/series/freenode) on
my blog where I process the events that lead to the death of freenode, the
largest IRC network for peer-directed projects.

freenode was the reason that I managed to get into tech. Without freenode I
would be a vastly different person today. The death of freenode last year
brought up many lingering memories and emotions. I talk about my history with
freenode, the events that happened in the wake of its death and how a new
community took its place.

Each part of this story is written by weaving the narrative of the last
caretaker trying to protect the discussion halls against the darkness, and
things continue as the darkness gets more crafty and clever.

I have included versions of this for all common eBook reader devices and
formats. I have tested this on my Kindle Oasis and iPad Pro, but I see no reason
that at least one of these formats wouldn't work for you.
