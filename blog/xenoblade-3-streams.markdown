[Xenoblade Chronicles 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade_Chronicles_3)
is set to come out on this friday, July 29th. I plan to stream the game all
weekend on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/princessxen). If you want to come and
watch, please join me on Twitch at midnight EDT. I will stream it for an hour or
two and then go to bed and proceed to stream more when I wake up, minus life
things. Saturday and Sunday should be the days with the most streaming in them.

But yeah I hope this will be fun! Fair warning though, I will be casually
talking about Xenoblade series spoilers.
