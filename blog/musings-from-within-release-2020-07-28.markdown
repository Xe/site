I am happy to announce that I have successfully created an eBook compilation of
the best of the posts on this blog plus a bunch of writing I have never before
made public, and the result is now available for purchase on
[itch.io](https://withinstudios.itch.io/musings-from-within) and the Kindle
Store (TODO(Xe): add kindle link here when it gets approved) for USD$5. This
book is the product of 5 years of effort writing, getting better at writing,
failing at writing and everything inbetween.

I have collected the following essays, poems, recipes and stories:

- Against Label Permanence
- A Letter to Those Who Bullied Me
- All There is is Now
- Alone
- Barrier
- Bricks
- Chaos Magick Debugging
- Chicken Stir Fry
- Creator’s Mission
- Death
- Died to Save Me
- Don't Look Into the Light
- Every Koan Ever
- Final Chapter
- Gratitude

- How HTTP Requests Work
- Humanity
- I Love
- Instant Pot Quinoa Taco Bowls
- Instant Pot Spaghetti
- I Put Words on this Webpage so You Have to Listen to Me Now
- I Remember
- It Is Free
- Listen to Your Rubber Duck
- MrBeast is Postmodern Gold
- My Experience Cursing Out God
- Narrative of Sickness
- One Day
- Plurality-Driven Development
- Practical Kasmakfa
- Questions
- Second Go Around
- Self
- Sorting Time
- Tarot for Hackers
- The Gears and The Gods
- The Origin of h
- The Service is Already Down
- The Story of Hol
- The Sumerian Creation Myth
- Toast Sandwich Recipe
- Untitled Cyberpunk Furry Story
- We Exist
- What It’s Like to Be Me
- When Then Zen
- When Then Zen: Anapana
- When Then Zen: Wonderland Immersion
- You Are Fine

Most of these are available on this site, but a good portion of them are not
available anywhere else. There's poetry about shamanism, stories about
reincarnation, koans and more.

I am also uploading eBook files to my
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cadey) page.
Anyone who supports me for $1 or more has [immediate
access](https://www.patreon.com/posts/39825969)
to the DRM-free ePub, MOBIPocket and PDF files of this book.

If you are facing financial difficulties, want to read my book and just simply
cannot afford it, please [contact me](/contact) and I will send you my book free
of charge.

Feedback and reviews of this book are more than welcome. If you decide to tweet
or toot about it, please use the hashtag `#musingsfromwithin` so I can collect
them into future updates to the description of the store pages, as well as
assemble them below.

Enjoy the book! My hope is that you get as much from it as I've gotten from
writing these things for the last 5 or so years. Here's to five more. I'll
likely create another anthology/collection of them at that point.
