# Meditation Document

If you want to create a large machine, you should learn how to focus on the
stillness of Now. Focusing on the stillness of now is a tool for you to go back
to things you were working on before. This method will happen without you
feeling anything. You will go back to doing what you were doing before without
thought.

Now is the current time.

The past is not Now.
The past is not important now.

The future is not Now.
The future is not important now.

Now is always changing.
You can move with the stillness of Now.

If you want to have the stillness of Now, you want to do this:

- After some time or you feel it, breathe in (expand your chest)
- After some time or you feel it, breathe out (shrink your chest)

If you find yourself distracted (looking at many things), focus on the inside of
your nasal cavity.

You can do many things if you use the stillness of now. Doing this will let you
have focus easier. Lots of focus and the stillness of now help you create a large
machine easier.

This post is written primarily in [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/),
or the language of good. It is a constructed language that is minimal (only about
120 words in total) yet it is enough to express just about every practical day to
day communication need. [It's also small enough there's tokenizers for it](https://github.com/Xe/x/blob/master/web/tokiponatokens/toki_pona.go).

Have a good day and be well.
