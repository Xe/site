# Deprecation Notice: Elemental-IRCd

[Elemental-IRCd](https://github.com/Elemental-IRCd/elemental-ircd) is a scalable, lightweight, high-performance IRC daemon written in C with heritage in the original IRC daemon. It is a fork of the now-defunct ShadowIRCD and sought to continue in the direction ShadowIRCD was headed. This software has scaled to support live chat for thousands of users at once in one->one and one->many groups. Working on this software has legitimately been a vital driving force to my career and skill balance between administration, development, moderation and operations of distirbuted communities at scale. Without this software, my closest friends (and even my fianc√©) would be strangers to me.

However, the result is something I don't know if I can continue to keep maintaining. It's been through a lot. The code has been through so many hands, some files had different licenses compared to the rest of the software. It is a patchwork of patches on top of a roughly solid core, and it's become a burden to maintain.

I am no longer going to support Elemental-IRCd anymore. There are no longer any significant users of this daemon, as far as I know. If you are a user of this software and want to continue using it, please fork it if you need to make any changes. Also, thank you so much for using it.

I have uploaded the final version of Elemental-IRCd to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/xena/elemental-ircd). To use it:

```
$ docker pull xena/elemental-ircd
$ docker run --name elemental-ircd -p 6667:6667
```

Then connect with an [IRC client](https://ircv3.github.io/software/clients.html) to `127.0.0.1:6667`. Connect other clients to that host+port and have them all join `#chat`. Nobody is going to be able to become an operator (via `/OPER`) because the [example config](https://github.com/Elemental-IRCd/elemental-ircd/blob/master/doc/example.conf#L267) won't allow it. If you can get it working though, the command to oper-up is `/OPER god powertrip`.

Please don't choose this software if you are starting a new IRC network.
