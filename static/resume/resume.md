## Portfolio Highlights

### [Olin](https://github.com/Xe/olin)

An embeddable userspace kernel for executing WebAssembly programs.
The main goal of this is to allow for an easier migration to another CPU
architecture (such as RISC-V, aarch64 or ppc64be) without having to recompile
existing code.

I have written multiple blogposts on this project:

- https://christine.website/blog/olin-1-why-09-1-2018
- https://christine.website/blog/olin-2-the-future-09-5-2018
- https://christine.website/blog/olin-progress-2019-12-14

As of March 21, 2019, Olin is able to run binaries compiled with [Go 1.12.x
WebAssembly support](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly). Olin also
is known to work on big-endian systems with no changes needed to source code or
binaries.

It also supports security policies similar to a combination of the OSX sandbox
profiles and OpenBSD's pledge() system call. This allows users to limit the
scope of what resources an Olin program can access, including file URLs, the
amount of ram that can be used or the number of WebAssembly instructions that
can be executed.

### [Wasmcloud](https://tulpa.dev/within/wasmcloud)

Wasmcloud is a Heroku or AWS Lambda-like functions as a service backend and
platform for event-driven architecture built on top of WebAssembly. It wraps
[Olin](https://github.com/Xe/olin) and provides a lot of higher-level
conveniences for users. I have written [a
blogpost](https://christine.website/blog/wasmcloud-progress-2019-12-08) on my
progress and where I'm wanting to go with this project.

### [ilo Kesi](https://github.com/Xe/x/tree/master/discord/ilo-kesi)

A chatbot that parses its commands through the grammar of the constructed
language [Toki Pona](http://tokipona.org), then figures out what the user is
asking for using a lookup table and executes that request.

### When Then Zen

[When Then Zen](https://when-then-zen.christine.website) is meditation instructions translated into Gherkin, a-la:

```
Feature: Anapana (mindfulness via breathing) meditation
  Background:
    Given no assumption about meditation background
    And a willingness to learn
    And no significant problems with breathing through the body's nose
    And I am seated or laying down comfortably
    And no music is playing

  Scenario Outline: mindfulness of breathing
    As a meditator
    In order to be mindful of the body's breath
    When I <verb> through the body's nose
    Then I focus on the sensations of breath
    Then I focus on the feelings of breath through the nasal cavity
    Then I focus on the feelings of breath interacting with the nostrils
    Then I repeat until done

    Examples:
      | verb   |
      | inhale |
      | exhale |
```

This has been well-recieved by coworkers, friends and others. I have written more on the subject [here](https://christine.website/blog/when-then-zen-anapana-2018-08-15).
