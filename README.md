My personal/portfolio website.

## <big>Information for people wishing to use this code</big>

Don't. This code is not made for you to be able to use without extensive
modification. The [license](https://github.com/Xe/site/blob/main/LICENSE) of
this code is intentionally chosen in such a way that it will make reuse of this
website code verbatim very difficult.

If you are still adamant about using this backend, please keep several things in
mind:

1. All blog content is all rights reserved. I aggressively pursue and report
   content theft.
2. You _must_ fully comply with the license. I will aggressively pursue people
   that are not in compliance with the license.
3. You are on your own. I will not help you. This is code I made for myself and
   it's only really open source as a side effect of making deployment on NixOS
   easier. Please do not be the person that makes me have to take this repo
   closed source.
4. Upon security issues being found and remediated, you will not be notified
   about issues or remediation instructions.

This is probably not what you are looking for. Make your own website. Look into
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). They are going to
be better maintained than this site will be.
